The **virtual work** $\delta W$ done by a [[force]] $\mathbf{F}$ on a mechanical [[Physical system|system]] is the [[work]] that the force *would* do over a [[virtual displacement]] $\delta \mathbf{r}$. Mathematically, it is the [[scalar product]] between the two:
$$\delta W=\mathbf{F}\cdot \delta \mathbf{r}$$
Just like virtual displacements, the emphasis on "would" is important because virtual never actually *happens*. It is purely theoretical.
