A **virtual displacement** (or **infinitesimal displacement**) $\delta \mathbf{r}$ of a mechanical [[Physical system|system]] is the change in [[Generalized coordinates|configuration]] that satisfies all of the [[Constraint|constraints]] imposed on the system at a *fixed* time $t$. It is called "virtual" because it is represents a *possibility*: it represent how the system *can* move at any given point in time while respecting constraints, not a displacement that actually happens (which would be written $d\mathbf{r}$ and would happen over a time interval $dt$). This is why time being fixed is emphasized in the definition: nothing actually *happens*, virtual displacement is a purely theoretical quantity and may not even equal the real displacement.

Mathematically, for a system with [[configuration space]] $Q$, virtual displacements at a point $P\in Q$ belong to the [[tangent space]] $T_{P}Q$ (for [[Constraint|holonomic]] systems) or a subspace of it (for nonholonomic systems). Since displacements span $T_{P}Q$ in holonomic systems, we can express them as a [[linear combination]] of a [[basis]] of $T_{P}Q$:
$$\delta \mathbf{r}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{ \partial \mathbf{r} }{ \partial q_{i} }\delta q_{i} ,\quad \delta q_{i}\in \mathbb{R}$$
where $n$ is the dimension of $Q$, i.e. the [[degrees of freedom]] of the system and $\delta q_{i}$ are displacements on the axes of $T_{P}Q$. $\mathbf{r}$ is the position vector of a point (here considered to be the entire system) that is a function of the [[generalized coordinates]]: $\mathbf{r}\equiv \mathbf{r}(q_{1},\ldots,q_{N})$.
