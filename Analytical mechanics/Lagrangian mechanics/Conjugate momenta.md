**Conjugate momenta** are [[Dynamical variable|dynamical variables]] that generalize the idea of [[Linear momentum|momentum]] to [[generalized coordinates]] in both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems.

Given a [[Lagrangian]] $L$ with $n$ [[degrees of freedom]] over the generalized coordinate $q(t)$, the $l$-th conjugate momentum is defined as
$$P_{l}(q,\dot{q},t)\equiv \frac{ \partial L }{ \partial \dot{q}_{l} } (q,\dot{q},t)$$
