**Canonical coordinates** are a [[set]] of coordinates that identify a location in [[phase space]] at any point in time. They are in general the [[generalized coordinates]] $\mathbf{q}$ and their [[conjugate momenta]] $\mathbf{p}$. Canonical coordinates can be converted into other canonical coordinates through a [[canonical transformation]].
