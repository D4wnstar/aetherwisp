The **phase space** of a [[physical system]] is the space containing all possible [[stato|states]] of the system in a given parameterization. In mechanical systems, the parameters are typically the position $\mathbf{q}$ and the momentum $\mathbf{p}$ of each [[Particella|particle]]. Each point in phase space uniquely represents one possible state and is called a **representative point**.
