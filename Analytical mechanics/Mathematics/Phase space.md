The **phase space** of a [[physical system]] is the space containing all possible [[stato|states]] of the system in a given parameterization. It is the space of [[canonical coordinates]] of the system. In mechanical systems, the parameters are typically the position $\mathbf{q}$ and the [[Linear momentum|momentum]] $\mathbf{p}$ of each [[Particella|particle]], but more generally they are the [[generalized coordinates]] and [[conjugate momenta]]. For a system with $n$ [[degrees of freedom]], the phase space is $2n$ dimensional. Each point in phase space uniquely represents one possible state and is called a **representative point**.

In differential geometry terms, the phase space is the [[cotangent bundle]] of the [[configuration space]].
