**Degrees of freedom** are a quantitative description of the number of "ways a [[Physical system|system]] can move". The concept of motion here is not necessarily typical mechanical movement, and is more generally the change of any parameter.

A [[Physical system|system]] is said to have $n$ degrees of freedom if it is has that many [[Generalized coordinates|free coordinates]]. The number of degrees of freedom is the dimension of the [[configuration space]].
