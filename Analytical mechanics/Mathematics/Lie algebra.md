A **Lie algebra** is a [[vector space]] equipped with a product $\cdot$ with the following properties:
1. It is bilinear: $a\cdot(\beta b\cdot \gamma c)=\beta a\cdot b+\gamma a\cdot c$.
2. It is antisymmetric: $a\cdot b=-b\cdot a$.
3. It satisfies the Jacobi identity: $a\cdot(b\cdot c)+b\cdot(c\cdot a)+c\cdot(a\cdot b)=0$.

Generally speaking, this operation is either the [[Poisson brackets]] or the [[Commutator]].
