The **configuration space** $Q$ of a [[Physical system|system]] is the [[differentiable manifold]] of all possible configurations it can take, as determined by the [[generalized coordinates]]. In unconstrained systems, it typically coincides with $\mathbb{R}^{N}$, some other well known set like the $SO(3)$ [[special orthogonal group]] or some combination of them, like $\mathbb{R}^{3}\times SO(3)$. When one or more [[Constraint|constraints]] are added, the configuration space shrinks as the system becomes disallowed from achieving certain configurations. A point in configuration space is called a **configuration**. The dimension of $Q$ is said to the be [[degrees of freedom]] of the system and is also the number of [[Generalized coordinates|free coordinates]] it has.

A configuration space describes positions. Velocities, on the other hand, which are the time derivatives of the generalized coordinates, exist in a related space called the [[tangent space]] $T_{P}Q$, where $P$ is some configuration. Position and velocity are, when considered simultaneously, sufficient to determine the [[stato|state]] of the system. The space that these occupy is the [[tangent bundle]] $TQ$ of $Q$, which can be thought of as the union of all tangent spaces of $Q$.

Similarly, if you have access to a [[Lagrangian]] or [[Hamiltonian]], you can find the [[Linear momentum|momenta]] known as [[conjugate momenta]]. Like velocities, when combined with position they are sufficient to determine state (and are called [[canonical coordinates]]). The space that these occupy is the [[cotangent bundle]] $T^{*}Q$ of $Q$, which is related but not the same as the aforementioned tangent bundle. This space is important enough to warrant its own name: the [[phase space]].

Using the configuration space, motion can be seen as a two step process: it is a function $\mathbf{r}(t)$ that, for each time $t$, gives a configuration in $Q$, then the configuration can be "translated" to unconstrained space using the [[coordinate transformation]] implicit in $Q$. It looks something like this:
$$\mathbf{r}(t):\mathbb{R}\text{ (time)}\to Q\text{ (configuration)}\to \mathbb{R}^{N}\text{ (position)}$$
