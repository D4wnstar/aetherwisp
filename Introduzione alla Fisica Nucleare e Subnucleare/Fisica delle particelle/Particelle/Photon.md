A **photon** is an [[Particella|elementary particle]] that acts as the quantum and carrier of [[Interazione elettromagnetica|electromagnetic interaction]]. It is a [[bosone|boson]] with [[spin]] 1 and zero [[mass]]. Being a massless particle, its [[energy]] is determined by its frequency through the [[Formula di Planck|Planck formula]].

 Each photon carries a [[polarizzazione|polarization]] described by a [[Normalizzazione|normalized]] **polarization vector** $\hat{\varepsilon}$. Since there are only two polarization states for a photon (left and right), $\hat{\varepsilon}$ only has two valid values. The polarization is always [[Ortogonalit√†|orthogonal]] to the photon's [[wave vector]]: $\hat{\varepsilon}\cdot \mathbf{k}=0$.
