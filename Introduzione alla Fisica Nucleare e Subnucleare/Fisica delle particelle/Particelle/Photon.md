A **photon** is an [[Particle|elementary particle]] that acts as the quantum and carrier of [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic interaction]]. It is a [[Boson|boson]] with [[spin]] 1 and zero [[mass]]. Being a massless particle, its [[energy]] is determined by its frequency through the [[Planck formula|Planck formula]] $E=\hbar \omega$.

 Each photon carries a [[polarizzazione|polarization]] described by a [[Normalization|normalized]] **polarization vector** $\hat{\varepsilon}$. Since there are only two polarization [[Equazione agli autovalori|eigenstates]] for a photon (left circular and right circular), $\hat{\varepsilon}$ only has two valid states. The polarization is always [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] to the photon's [[Wavenumber|wavevector]]: $\hat{\varepsilon}\cdot \mathbf{k}=0$. It is possible to make more polarizations by [[linear combination|linearly combining]] polarization vectors.
