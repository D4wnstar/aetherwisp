**Shannon's source coding theorem** provides a lower bound for the minimum average length of a message for a given [[source code]]. This lower bound is the [[Entropy (information theory)|Shannon entropy]].

> [!info] Source coding theorem
> Given a source of entropy $H_{X}$ and an instantaneous source code of average length $L$, the following always holds:
> $$L\geq H_{X}$$
> The average length can be at best equal to the source's entropy. This is independent of the used alphabet.
