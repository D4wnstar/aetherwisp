The **prior distribution** or **prior** is an assumed probability distribution that represents existing knowledge about a process. In other words, it is the probability distribution assumed in the absence of data about the problem.

It is a fundamental component of [[Bayes' theorem]], where it is weighted by the [[likelihood]] function of the statistical model's parameters to obtain the [[posterior]].

Priors can contain varying degrees of information: often, there is little prior knowledge about the problem at hand, in which case a generic, weakly informative prior is chosen. The simplest example is given by the [[principle of indifference]], which states that, in the absence of relevant evidence about an event's distribution, the event can be assumed to follow a uniform distribution.
