The **posterior distribution** or **posterior** is the probability distribution obtained by _updating_ the [[Prior]] with new information expressed by the [[Likelihood]] through [[Bayes' theorem]]. The posterior contains all the information regarding a proposition, such as a scientific hypothesis or the parameters of a model. Specifically in Bayesian inference, the posterior represents the probability distribution of the parameters being estimated, and the mode of this distribution is the best estimate of these parameters.
