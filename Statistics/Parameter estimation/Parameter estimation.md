**Parameter estimation** is the statistical process which is used to find the parameters that make a mathematical relation **fit** a set of [[sample|sampled]] data. It is also called **fitting** (data to a model). Given some initial data $X$ (could be one or more [[Random variable|random variables]]), we want to find the parameters $\theta_{1},\ldots,\theta_{N}$ such that a function $f(X;\theta_{1},\ldots,\theta_{N})$ is minimizes some quantity with respect to $X$.
