The **$F$ distribution** is a real, continuous [[probability distribution]] defined as the ratio of two [[Chi-square distribution|chi-square distributions]]. For two chi-square-distributed [[random variable|random variables]] $X$ and $Y$, the [[probability density function]] is
$$F=\frac{X/n}{Y/m}$$
where $n$ and $m$ are the respective [[degrees of freedom]] of $X$ and $Y$.
