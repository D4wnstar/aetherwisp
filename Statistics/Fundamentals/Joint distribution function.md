The **joint distribution function** of a set of $N$ [[random variable|random variables]] defined on the same [[sample space]] is the function that describes the [[probability]] of every possible combination of outcomes.

In the specific case of [[independent variables]], the joint distribution function is just the product of each individual [[probability density function]] or [[probability mass function]], as
$$f(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n})=f_{1}(x_{1})\ldots f_{n}(x_{n})$$
