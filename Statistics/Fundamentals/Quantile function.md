The **quantile function** is a function associated with a [[random variable]] that maps a [[probability]] to the value that the variable should take at that probability according to the [[probability density function]]. It is also called the **inverse cumulative distribution function** since it is just that, the inverse of the [[Cumulative distribution function|CDF]].

Mathematically, the quantile function of a random variable $X$ of CDF $F_{X}$ is defined as
$$Q_{X}(p)\equiv F^{-1}_{X}(p)=\min(x|F_{X}(x)\geq p)$$
