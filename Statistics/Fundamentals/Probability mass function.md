A **probability mass function** (**PMF**) is a function associated with a discrete [[random variable]] that gives the [[probability]] that the variable, when measured, is exactly equal to some value. The PMF describes the [[probability distribution]] that a discrete variable follows.

Given a discrete random variable $X$, its probability mass function $p_{X}$ is defined as $p_{X}:\Omega_{X}\mapsto[0,1]$, where $\Omega_{X}$ is $X$'s [[sample space]]. It is equal to
$$p_{X}(x)=P(X=x)$$
where $P$ is a [[measure]] of probability. By definition of probability, the total probability must be 1:
$$\sum_{x \in \Omega}p_{X}(x)=1 $$
