The **marginal distribution function** of a set of $N$ [[random variable|random variables]] is the function that gives the [[probability]] of a specific outcome for one of the variables independently of the outcomes of all other variables. Given a [[joint distribution function]] $f(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n})$, the marginal distribution function is
$$f_{M1}(x_{1})=\int_{\Omega_{2}}dx_{2}\ldots \int_{\Omega_{n}}dx_{n} f(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n})$$
where the $\Omega$ are the [[sample space|sample spaces]] of the random variables.
