**Jensen's inequality** is an inequality that characterizes convex functions. In the context of probability theory, it states that, given a function $f$ of a [[random variable]] $X$, if $f$ is [[convexity|convex]], then
$$E[f(X)]\geq f(E[X])$$
where $E$ is the [[expected value]].

A function $f(x)$ is said to be **convex** if
$$\forall x,y\in \mathbb{R} \quad\text{and}\quad \forall \alpha \in[0,1] ,\quad f(\alpha x+(1-\alpha)y)\leq \alpha f(x)+(1-\alpha)f(y)$$
