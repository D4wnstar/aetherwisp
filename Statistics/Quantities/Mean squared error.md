The **mean squared error** or **mean squared deviation** of a [[sample]] is the [[mean]] of the squares of the errors:
$$\text{MSE}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i}-\mu)^{2}$$
where $x_{i}$ is the $i$-th sample, $\mu$ is the mean of the sample and $n$ is the sample size. If the [[estimator]] is unbiased, it coincides with the [[Variance]].
