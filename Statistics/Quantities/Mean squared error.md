The **mean squared error** or **mean squared deviation** of a [[sample]] is the [[mean]] of the squares of the errors:
$$\text{MSE}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i}-\mu)^{2}$$
where $x_{i}$ is the $i$-th sample, $\mu$ is the mean of the sample and $n$ is the sample size.

It can also be calculated for a [[random variable]] $X$ as
$$\text{MSE}=\frac{E[X^{2}]-E[X]^{2}}{E[X]^{2}}$$
(TODO: Check if this is correct, definition by Trombettoni in statistical mechanics)
