Two [[Nuclide|nuclides]] are said to be **isotopes** if they have the same proton number $Z$ but different neutron numbers $N$ (equivalently, different atomic mass number $A$). Since a chemical element is identified by its proton number $Z$, it's common to talk about about the "isotopes of an element". For example, chlorine $(Z=17)$ has two main stable isotopes, $\ce{^{35}_{17}Cl}$ and $\ce{^{37}_{17}Cl}$, and one main unstable one, $\ce{^{36}_{17}Cl}$.
