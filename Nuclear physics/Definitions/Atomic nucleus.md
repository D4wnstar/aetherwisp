The **atomic nucleus** is the central region of an [[atom]], composed of a collection of [[proton|protons]] and [[neutron|neutrons]] (collectively termed **nucleons**) bound together by the [[Fundamental interaction#Strong interaction|strong interaction]]. The nucleus contains almost all the atomâ€™s [[mass]] and carries a net positive [[electric charge]]. Despite the heavy mass, its size is tiny compared to that the whole atom: nuclear radii are usually in the order of $\sim 10^{-15}\text{ m}$, as opposed to atomic sizes which are $\sim 10^{-10}\text{ m}$.

The existence of a dense central nucleus was discovered by Rutherford in 1911 through the [[Rutherford experiment]].

A [[nuclide]] is a related concept that classifies atoms based on their nucleus.
### Stability
Atomic nuclei can be **unstable**, which means that they undergo spontaneous [[nuclear decay]], a process that generally leads to the expulsion of one or more nucleons in order to remove sources of instability. Instability becomes progressively more common as nuclear [[binding energy]] per nucleon reduces, which corresponds to increasing $A$. Moreover, instability is caused by excesses in number of protons or neutrons. There are three main categories of decay: [[alpha decay]], [[beta decay]] and [[gamma decay]]. See [[Nuclide#Stability]] for more.
