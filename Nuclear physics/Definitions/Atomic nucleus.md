The **atomic nucleus** is the central region of an [[atom]], composed of a collection of [[proton|protons]] and [[neutron|neutrons]] (collectively termed **nucleons**) bound together by the [[Fundamental interaction#Strong interaction|strong interaction]]. The nucleus contains almost all the atomâ€™s [[mass]] and carries a net positive [[electric charge]]. Despite the heavy mass, its size is tiny compared to that the whole atom: nuclear radii are usually in the order of $\sim 10^{-15}\text{ m}$, as opposed to atomic sizes which are $\sim 10^{-10}\text{ m}$.

The existence of a dense central nucleus was discovered by Rutherford in 1911 through the [[Rutherford experiment]].

A [[nuclide]] is a related concept that classifies atoms based on their nucleus.
