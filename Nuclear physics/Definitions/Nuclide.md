A **nuclide** is a class of [[atom|atoms]] characterized by their atomic number $Z$, atomic mass number $A$ (equivalently, number of neutrons $N$) and nuclear [[energy]] state[^1]. For instance, $\ce{^{12}_{6}C}$ is a stable carbon nuclide.

A nuclide is conventionally said to be **(observationally) stable** if it has never been observed to [[Decadimento nucleare|decay]]. Numerically, it is stable if its [[mean lifetime]] is longer than the age of the Solar System, which is about 4.6 billion years. It is **unstable** otherwise. Unstable nuclides are also called **radionuclides**, since they exhibit [[Nuclear decay|radioactive decay]].

Instability can arise from several factors; the [[semi-empirical mass formula]] provides a good estimate of a nucleusâ€™s [[binding energy]], which we can use to model instability. The lower this energy, the less stable the nucleus (except for very light nuclei at the start of the curve, which are exceptions). See [[Binding energy#Nuclear separation energy]] for more discussion.
