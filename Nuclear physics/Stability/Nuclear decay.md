**Nuclear decay** or **radioactive decay** is the [[random]] process by which an unstable [[atomic nucleus]] loses [[energy]] through emission of [[radiation]] in order to become more stable. A nucleus decays into one or more nuclear nuclei or [[Particle|particles]], with fewer resulting particles being more common. In common terms, it's often called **radioactivity**.

For decay to occur at rest (that it, without external influence), it must be energetically favorable. For this to be possible, the mass of the original [[atom]] must be greater than the mass of all resulting particles, which implies an increase in [[binding energy]] and therefore greater stability. In the case of a two-body decay involving loss of nucleons, we can write
$$M(A,Z)>M(A-A',Z-Z')+M(A',Z')$$
where $A,Z$ are the [[Atom|mass number]] and [[Atom|atomic number]] of the original atom and $A'$ and $Z'$ are the number of nucleons/protons that got ejected by the decay.
### Mode
There are three main modes of decay exist:
- **[[Alpha decay]]**, which leads to the emission of a helium nucleus (called an $\alpha$ particle);
- **[[Beta decay]]**, which converts a [[proton]] into a [[neutron]] or vice versa;
- **[[Gamma decay]]**, which leads to the emission of a high-energy [[photon]].

Another mode, somewhat different, is **[[spontaneous fission]]**, occurring only for very heavy nuclei ($Z\gtrsim110$), where the nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei instead of emitting single particles.

Fermium $^{256}\text{Fm}$ and californium $^{254}\text{Cf}$ are examples exhibiting spontaneous fission.
### Mechanism
The exact mechanism depends on the type decay of decay. It is nonetheless possible to create a high-level macroscopic theory that describes the loss of [[mass]] and nuclei in an unstable object due to decay irrespective of type. This common treatment is available via the [[radioactive decay law]].
