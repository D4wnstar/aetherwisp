**Transient equilibrium** is the state of a [[Radioactive decay law|decay chain]] in which the [[Activity|activities]] of a parent-daughter [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] pair have a constant ratio. In this state, the daughter nuclei rate of decay follows that of the parents.

Transient equilibrium is generally reached after a transient period of non-equilibrium production-decay in which one of the two processes is faster than the other, but not by that much. Mathematically, this means that the [[Radioactive decay law|decay constant]] of the parent is smaller, but not negligible, compared to the daughter[^1]. Transient equilibrium is the asymptotic behavior of some nuclear processes.

An example is the decay of $\ce{^{234}U}(2.45\times10^{5}\text{ years})$ into $\ce{^{230}Th}(8.0\times10^{4}\text{ years})$, where the  ratio tends to 1.48. This means that $\ce{^{230}Th}$ eventually decays at precisely $1.48$ times the rate of $\ce{^{234}U}$.
