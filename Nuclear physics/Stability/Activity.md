**Activity** is the number of [[Nuclear decay|decays]] per unit time in a macroscopic sample of a radioactive object:
$$A(t)=\lambda N(t)=A_{0}e^{-\lambda t}\quad\text{with}\quad A_{0}=\lambda N_{0},$$
where $N(t)$ is the number of [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] left at time $t$ (see [[Radioactive decay law]]) and $\lambda$ the [[Radioactive decay law|decay constant]].

Activity is measured in **Becquerel**: $1\text{ Bq}=1\text{ decays/s}$. Historically the **Curie** was also used: $1\text{ Ci}=3.7\times10^{10}\text{ decays/s}$, which is the activity of one gram of radium.
