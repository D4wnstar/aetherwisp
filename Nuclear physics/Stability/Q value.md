The **$\boldsymbol{Q}$ value** of a [[nuclear decay]] process is the [[energy]] released by the decay. It is the difference of the [[Relativistic energy|rest energies]] before and after the decay:
$$Q=(m_\text{before}-m_\text{after})c^{2}$$
where $c$ is the [[speed of light]]. Equivalently, by conservation of energy, it is the [[kinetic energy]] difference:
$$Q=K_\text{after}-K_\text{before}$$
Be careful: the ordering of the difference is inverted compared to the rest energy. The $Q$ value is very useful to determine if the process occurs naturally: if it is positive, the process is spontaneous (exothermic), otherwise it is not (endothermic). The higher the $Q$ value is, the more energetically favored the process is, thus making it more common compared to other possible processes.
