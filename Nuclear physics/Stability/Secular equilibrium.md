**Secular equilibrium** is the state of a decaying object in which the [[Radioactive decay law|rate of production]] is equal to the [[Nuclear decay|decay]] [[activity]]. In this state, the number of unstable [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] remains constant in time.

Secular equilibrium is generally reached after a transient period of non-equilibrium production-decay in which one of the two processes is much faster than the other. Mathematically, this means that the [[Radioactive decay law|decay constant]] of the parent nuclei is much smaller than the daughters'[^1]. Secular equilibrium is the asymptotic behavior of some nuclear processes.

An example is the decay chain $\ce{^{132}Te}(78\text{ h}) \rightarrow\ \ce{^{132}I}(2.28\text{ h}) \rightarrow\ \ce{^{132}Xe}(\text{stable})$, in which the iodine gets into secular equilibrium about 12 hours after the start of the chain.

[^1]: If it smaller, but not by enough to be considered negligible, you get [[transient equilibrium]] instead.
