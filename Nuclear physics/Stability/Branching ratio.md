In [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] that [[Nuclear decay|decay]] in more than one mode, **branching ratios** (**BR**) are numbers that determine how likely one decay mode is compared to the others. They are numbers between 0 and 1 and as such may be interpreted as the [[probability]] of a given decay mode occurring. Over an entire material, they are the fraction of the material that decays in that mode. The total of all branching ratios for a [[nuclide]] must equal one:
$$\text{BR}_{1}+\ldots+\text{BR}_{N}=1\quad\text{where}\quad\text{BR}_{i}\in[0,1]$$
Branching ratios are useful to determine the partial [[Radioactive decay law|decay constants]] and partial [[half-life|half-lives]], since they are just the product of the total decay constant or half-life by the appropriate branching ratio:
$$\lambda _\text{partial}=\lambda _\text{total}\cdot\text{BR},\quad t_{1/2,\text{partial}}=t_{1/2,\text{total}}\cdot\text{BR}$$

> [!example]- Actinium-226
>For example, actinium-226 [[Alpha decay|alpha decays]] 0.006% of the time, [[Beta decay|beta minus decays]] 83% of the time, and [[Beta decay|captures an electron]] 17% of the time. The branching ratios are
> - 0.00006 ($\alpha$)
> - 0.83 ($\beta^{-}$)
> - 0.17 (EC)

> Rounding prevents an precise sum to one, but are otherwise consistent. Branching ratios can be used to find the partial decay constants and half-lives from the total decay constant. The half-life of actinium-226 is $t_{1/2}=29\text{ h}$, so the total decay constant is $\lambda_{t}=6.6\times10^{-6}\text{ s}^{-1}$. The partial constants will therefore be
> $$\begin{align}
> \lambda_{\beta^{-}}&=0.83\lambda_{t}=5.5\times10^{6}\text{ s}^{-1} \\
> \lambda_{\text{EC}}&=0.17\lambda_{t}=1.1\times10^{-6}\text{ s}^{-1} \\
> \lambda_{\alpha}&=6\times10^{-5}\lambda_{t}=4\times10^{-10}\text{ s}^{-1}
> \end{align}$$
> and the partial half-lives
> $$\begin{align}
> t_{1/2,\beta^{-}}&=\frac{\ln2}{\lambda_{\beta}}=1.3\times10^{5}\text{ s}=35\text{ h} \\
> t_{1/2,\text{EC}}&=\frac{\ln2}{\lambda_{\text{EC}}}=6.1\times10^{5}\text{ s}=170\text{ h} \\
> t_{1/2,\alpha}&=\frac{\ln2}{\lambda_{\alpha}}=1.7\times10^{9}\text{ s}=55\text{ yr}
> \end{align}$$

The term also applies to [[Particle|particles]] and [[particle decay]] modes.
