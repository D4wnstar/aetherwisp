**Einstein summation notation** is a convention used in linear algebra, especially special relativity, general relativity and differential geometry, to make [[Vector space|vector]] notation more compact.

> [!info] Einstein notation
> When an index of a vector is repeated within an expression and is not otherwise defined, summation is implied over that index.

For example, using two [[Four-vector|four-vectors]] $a$ and $b$, the quantity $a_{\mu}b^{\mu}$ implicitly calls for a sum, since the index $\mu$ is repeated and not otherwise defined, so
$$a_{\mu}b^{\mu}\equiv \sum_{\mu=0}^{3}a_{\mu}b^{\mu} $$
Whenever the [[covariance and contravariance]] of a vector is explicitly written using upper and lower indexes (as shown here), the notation is generally considered to apply only on an index that is repeated once as superscript and once as subscript. For instance, $a_{\mu}b^{\mu}$ would imply a sum, but $a_{\mu}b_{\mu}$ would not.

These notes favor the use of Einstein notation whenever possible in fields where doing so is considered standard, namely the theory of relativity.
