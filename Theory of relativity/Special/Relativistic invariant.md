A **relativistic invariant** or **Lorentz scalar** is a [[scalar]] quantity that is [[Transformation invariance|invariant]] under a [[Lorentz transformation]].

The most common invariant is the [[scalar product]] of two [[Four-vector|four-vectors]]:
$$a\cdot b=-a_{0}b_{0}+a_{1}b_{1}+a_{2}b_{2}+a_{3}b_{3}=a_{\mu}b_{\nu}g^{\mu\nu}$$
$g^{\mu\nu}$ is the [[metric tensor]]. By extension, the [[norm]] of a four-vector is also invariant:
$$|a|^{2}=g_{\mu\nu}a^{\mu}a^{\nu}$$
Other important invariants include the [[proper time]], [[electric charge]] and [[Invariant mass|rest mass]].
