A **relativistic invariant** is a quantity that does not change under a [[Lorentz transformation]].
### Examples
The product of two [[Four-vector|four-vectors]] is a relativistic invariant:
$$a\cdot b=(a_{0}b_{0}-\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b})=a_{0}b_{0}-a_{1}b_{1}-a_{2}b_{2}-a_{3}b_{3}=a_{\mu}a_{\nu}g^{\mu\nu}$$
with $g^{\mu\nu}$ the [[metric tensor]].

The [[norm]] of a four-vector $|a|^{2}=g_{\mu\nu}a^{\mu}a^{\nu}$ is invariant.

The transverse momentum of a [[particle]], its azimuthal angle in [[spherical coordinates]], and the [[rapidity]] are other invariants.
