The theory of special relativity is based wholly on two fundamentals claims, known as the **postulates of special relativity**. They are:
1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial [[frame of reference|frames of reference]].
2. Light moves at a constant [[Speed of light|speed]] $c$ in all inertial frames of reference, and it is the maximum speed at which [[energy]] can propagate. 

These postulates lead to all the other phenomena that special relativity explains, namely [[relativity of simultaneousness]], [[time dilation]] and [[distance contraction]].
