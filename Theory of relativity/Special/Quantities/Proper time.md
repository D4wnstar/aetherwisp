The **proper time** of an object is a measure of time that takes into account the [[time dilation]] that the object experiences due to its velocity with respect to another [[frame of reference]]. It is the time measured by a moving clock. Since time passes slower for things in motion, the proper time is always smaller than the time measured by a clock at rest (in some frame). In infinitesimal form it is defined as
$$d\tau=\sqrt{ 1- \frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}} }dt=\frac{dt}{\gamma}$$
where $u$ is the speed of the object as measured by an observer at rest, $c$ is the [[speed of light]] and $\gamma$ is the [[Lorentz transformation|relativistic]] gamma. $dt$ is the time unit of a clock at rest. Proper time is a [[relativistic invariant]].

As usual, the concept of "at rest" is relative. That's kind of the whole point of "relativity", so be careful of how you measure $u$. You might claim that the time of someone on a train is dilated and therefore their proper time squished, but they might that *your* proper time is squished because from *their* perspective *you* are moving. It's the same deal of time dilation all over again (in fact, proper time is basically infinitesimal time dilation).
