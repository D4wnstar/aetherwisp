The **proper time** of an object is a measure of time that takes into account the [[time dilation]] that the object experiences due to its velocity with respect to another [[frame of reference]]. In infinitesimal form it is defined as
$$d\tau=\sqrt{ 1- \frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}} }dt=\frac{dt}{\gamma}$$
where $v$ is the speed of the object *relative to the observer*, $c$ is the [[speed of light]] and $\gamma$ is the [[Lorentz transformation|relativistic]] gamma. $dt$ is the time unit *in the frame of reference*. This is critical to the definition. Since time is relative, proper time can only be defined *in relation to* a frame of reference.
