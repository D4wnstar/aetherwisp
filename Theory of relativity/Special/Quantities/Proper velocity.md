**Proper velocity** or **4-velocity** $w$ is the velocity of an object relative to an observer is the derivative of the observer-measured [[spacetime]] displacement $x$ in the object's [[proper time]] $d\tau$:
$$\eta^{\mu}=\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\tau}=\gamma(v) v^{\mu}=(\eta^{0},\boldsymbol{\eta})$$
where $\gamma$ is the [[Lorentz factor]] and $v^{\mu}$ is the ordinary (four-)velocity.

| Quantity          | Symbol       | Displacement   | Time                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Ordinary velocity | $v^{\mu}$    | Observer frame | Observer frame clock time             |
| Proper velocity   | $\eta^{\mu}$ | Observer frame | Object frame clock time (Proper time) |

The time component is given by the [[speed of light]] as
$$\eta^{0}=\gamma c=\frac{c}{\sqrt{ 1- v^{2}/c^{2} }}$$
and the space component is
$$\boldsymbol{\eta}=\gamma \mathbf{v}=\frac{\mathbf{v}}{\sqrt{ 1-v^{2}/c^{2} }}$$
