The **invariant mass** or **rest mass** of a relativistic [[Physical system|system]] is the [[mass]] that is assigned to the system as a whole in the [[center-of-momentum frame]], where the total [[Linear momentum|momentum]] is zero. In that case, the [[Relativistic energy|mass-energy equivalence]] applies and we can state
$$m_{0}=\frac{E_\text{tot}}{c^{2}}$$
where $E_\text{tot}$ is the total [[relativistic energy]] of the system in the center-of-momentum frame (its rest energy). In frames with nonzero four-momentum, the invariant mass obeys
$$m_{0}^{2}c^{2}=\left( \frac{E_\text{tot}}{c} \right)^{2}-\lvert \mathbf{p}_\text{tot} \rvert ^{2}=\lvert p_\text{tot} \rvert ^{2}$$
where $p$ is the four-momentum. This makes it closely related to the [[center-of-mass energy]]. Sometimes when using [[natural units]] $\lvert p_\text{tot} \rvert^{2}$ is called the invariant mass and not $m_{0}$. This is because in natural units $c=1$ so $m_{0}^{2}=\lvert p_\text{tot} \rvert^{2}$. In this context, it can be seen as the square of the the center-of-mass energy.

The invariant mass is not the mass of any particular object. Rather, it's a property of the system that naturally appears due to the mass-energy equivalence in resting frames. As the name suggests, it is a [[relativistic invariant]].

Rest mass is especially useful in particle physics, as it provides an invariant quantity that stays the same both before and after a [[particle scattering]] or [[particle decay]] event. This is particularly useful in studying the kinematics of these events as, alongside conservation of momentum, it provides a universal statement that is quite useful in solving the equations, even in processes where the particles change.
