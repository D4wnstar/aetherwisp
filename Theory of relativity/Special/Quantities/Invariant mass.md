The **invariant mass** of a relativistic system is the squared [[norm]] of the total [[four-momentum]]:
$$\lvert p_{tot}^{\mu} \rvert^{2} =s=\left(\sum\limits_{k}E_{k}\right)^{2}-\left(\sum\limits_{k}\mathbf{p}\right)^{2}$$
As the name suggests, it is a [[relativistic invariant]]. The square root of the invariant mass is known as the [[center-of-mass energy]].
