A **four-vector** or **4-vector** is a [[Vector space|vector]] in four dimensions used to describe dynamics in [[spacetime]]. Three coordinates are spatial, while the fourth is temporal.
$$a_{\mu}=(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},a_{3})=(a_{0},\mathbf{a})$$
where $a_{0}$ is the time coordinate and $\mathbf{a}=(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3})$ are the spatial coordinates.

> [!question] A note on notation
> In relativity, since indexes are ever-present, we use a specific convention to denote what the indexes mean. This is known as [[Einstein notation]]. For four-vectors specifically, we identify two kinds of four-vectors: **covariant** and **contravariant**. Covariant four-vectors have their index written at the top, like $a^{\mu}=(a^{0},a^{1},a^{2},a^{3})$. Contravariant four-vectors have theirs written at the bottom, like $a_{\mu}=(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},a_{3})$. The difference between the two is the time coordinate, as $a^{0}=-a_{0}$. The space coordinates are unchanged. More formally, covariant and contravariant four-vectors are bound by the [[metric tensor]] $g_{\mu \nu}$ by $a_{\mu}=g_{\mu \nu}a^{\nu}$.

> Another convention is the lettering used. Four-vectors are generally indexed by Greek letters, typically $\mu$ and $\nu$, which go from $0$ to $3$. The spatial coordinates *specifically*, however, use Latin letters, typically $i$ and $j$, which go from $1$ to $3$. If you prefer, Latin letters are used for space, whereas Greek letters are used for space*time*.
