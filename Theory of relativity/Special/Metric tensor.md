The **metric tensor** $g_{\mu\nu}$ is the [[tensor]] associated with the [[scalar product]] in [[spacetime]] (specifically Minkowski space). It is used to describe the concept of distance in spacetime, hence the name "metric". It is defined as
$$g_{\mu\nu}=\begin{pmatrix}-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$$
and is applied to two [[four-vector|four-vectors]] as
$$a\cdot b=-a_{0}b_{0}+\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}=g^{\mu\nu}a_{\mu}b_{\nu}$$
The signature of this metric tensor is $(-++\ +)$. The signature $(+--\ -)$ is also a valid choice and leads to the same results. In the latter case, the scalar product would be
$$a\cdot b=a_{0}b_{0}-\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$$
The choice must be kept consistent to avoid mismatched formulas.
### Properties
- The metric tensor converts between [[Four-vector|covariant]] and [[Four-vector|contravariant four-vectors]]: $a_{\mu}=g_{\mu\nu}a^{\nu}$.
- The induced product $a\cdot b$ is a [[relativistic invariant]]. By extension, so is the induced [[norm]] $|a|^{2}=a\cdot a=g^{\mu\nu} a_{\mu}a_{\nu}$.
