The **metric tensor** $g_{\mu\nu}$ is the [[tensor]] associated with the [[scalar product]] in [[spacetime]] (specifically Minkowski space). It is used to describe the concept of distance in spacetime, hence the name "metric". It is defined as
$$g_{\mu\nu}=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1\end{pmatrix}$$
and is applied to two [[four-vector|four-vectors]] as
$$a\cdot b=a_{0}b_{0}-\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}=a_{\mu}b_{\nu}g^{\mu\nu}$$
### Properties
- The metric tensor converts between [[Four-vector|covariant]] and [[Four-vector|contravariant four-vectors]]: $a_{\mu}=g_{\mu\nu}a^{\nu}$.
- The induced [[norm]] is $|a|^{2}=a_{\mu}a^{\mu}=g_{\mu\nu} a^{\mu}a^{\nu}$.
