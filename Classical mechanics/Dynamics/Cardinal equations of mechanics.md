The **cardinal equations of mechanics** are a system of two equations that fully determine the dynamics of a system. They are
$$\begin{cases}
\vec{F}^{(e)}=\frac{d\vec{Q}}{dt} \\
\vec{M}^{(e)}_{\Omega}=\frac{d\vec{L}_\Omega}{dt}
\end{cases}$$
where $\vec{F}^{(e)}$ is the total external force and $\vec{M}^{(e)}_{\Omega}$ is the total external moment of force about the axis $\Omega$. $\vec{Q}$ is the linear momentum of the [[Center of mass]] and $\vec{L}_{\Omega}$ is its angular momentum.

If both equations are equal to zero, the object is in equilibrium.
