The **cardinal equations of mechanics** are a system of two equations that fully determine the dynamics of a system. They are
$$\left\{\begin{align}
\mathbf{F}^{(e)}=\frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt} \\
\mathbf{N}^{(e)}_{\Omega}=\frac{d\mathbf{L}_\Omega}{dt}
\end{align}\right.$$
where $\mathbf{F}^{(e)}$ is the total external [[force]] and $\mathbf{N}^{(e)}_{\Omega}$ is the total external [[moment of force]] about the axis $\Omega$. $\mathbf{p}$ is the [[linear momentum]] of the [[center of mass]] and $\mathbf{L}_{\Omega}$ is its [[angular momentum]].

If both equations are equal to zero, the object is in equilibrium.
