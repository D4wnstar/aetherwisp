**Viscosity** is a [[Dissipative force]] that occurs when an object moves within a fluid. It is analogous to [[Friction]], but for fluids. Viscosity is modeled to have a direction opposite to motion. In symbols:
$$\vec{F}=-c\vec{v}$$
where $c>0$ is the **viscosity coefficient**. Unlike friction, there is no distinction between a static and dynamic case.
