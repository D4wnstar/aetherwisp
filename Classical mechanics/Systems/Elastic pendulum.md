The **elastic pendulum** is a generalization of the [[simple pendulum]] where the length of the string is allowed to vary according to [[Harmonic oscillator|Hooke's law]], as if it were a massless spring.

The [[Hamiltonian]] of the elastic pendulum in [[polar coordinates]] is
$$H=\frac{p_{\theta}^{2}}{2mr^{2}}+ \frac{p_{r}^{2}}{2m}+mg(L_{0}-r\cos \theta)+ \frac{k}{2}(L_{0}-r)^{2}$$
where $r$ is the length of the spring, $L_{0}$ is its rest length, $m$ is the [[mass]], $g$ is the [[gravitational acceleration]], $k$ is the [[Harmonic oscillator|spring constant]] and $p_{r}$ and $p_{\theta}$ are the radial and angular momenta. The [[Hamilton equation|Hamilton equations]] are
$$\left\{\begin{align}
\dot{r}&=\frac{p_{r}}{m} \\
\dot{\theta}&=\frac{p_{\theta}}{mr^{2}} \\
\dot{p}_{r}&=\frac{p_{\theta}^{2}}{mr^{3}}+mg\cos \theta+k(L_{0}-r) \\
\dot{p}_{\theta}&=-mgr\sin \theta
\end{align}\right.$$
