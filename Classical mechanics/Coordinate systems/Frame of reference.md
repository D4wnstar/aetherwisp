A **frame of reference** is a system of coordinates used to described the position of an object in some space. The space is typically assumed to be "real space", $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. A frame of reference possesses an **origin**, a special point used as a reference for all other points, and a set of **axes**, which represent the possible directions in which an object can move.

Mathematically, a frame of reference is the choice of a [[basis]] within a [[vector space]], alongside the choice of a point of origin in that space. The most common frame of reference is [[Cartesian coordinates]] in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with $(0,0,0)$ set as the origin.

A frame of reference is said to be **inertial** if [[Newton's laws|Newton's first law]] holds within the frame and **noninertial** otherwise. In practice, the frame is inertial if the origin is at rest of it is moving at a constant velocity.
