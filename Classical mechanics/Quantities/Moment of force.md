The **moment of force** $\mathbf{N}$, or **torque**, of an object at position $\mathbf{r}$ about a point $O$ subject to a force $\mathbf{F}$ is the [[Vector product|cross product]]
$$\mathbf{N}=\mathbf{r}\times \mathbf{F}$$
where $\mathbf{r}$ is the vector connecting $O$ with the object. When referred to as "torque", it typically uses the letter $\tau$ instead. A moment of force generates an [[angular momentum]] $\mathbf{L}$ in the same fashion as a force generates a [[linear momentum]]. In fact, using [[Newton's laws|Newton's second law]]:
$$\mathbf{N}=\mathbf{r}\times \frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{r}\times \mathbf{p})=\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt}=\dot{\mathbf{L}}$$
