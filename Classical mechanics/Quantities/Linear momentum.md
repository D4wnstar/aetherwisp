The **linear momentum** $\mathbf{p}$, or just **momentum**, of an object with [[mass]] $m$ moving at a velocity $\mathbf{v}$ is the product
$$\mathbf{p}=m\mathbf{v}$$
A force $\mathbf{F}$ applied onto the object changes the momentum of the object according to [[Newton's laws|Newton's second law]]:
$$\mathbf{F}=\frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt}=\dot{\mathbf{p}}$$
also using dot notation for the derivative. From this we can immediately see the very important theorem of momentum conservation.

> [!info] Conservation of momentum
> If the total force $\mathbf{F}$ is zero, then $\dot{\mathbf{p}}=0$ and the linear momentum is conserved.

An equivalent theorem also holds for a system of [[Particella|particles]]:

> [!info] Conservation of the momentum of a system
> If the total *external* force $\mathbf{F}$ is zero, the total linear momentum is conserved.

External forces are those applied to the particles by external sources and not other particles. An example would be Earth's [[Interazione gravitazionale|gravity]] acting on a basket of balls.
