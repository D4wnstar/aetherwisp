The **Carnot cycle** is the most theoretically efficient [[thermodynamic transformation]] cycle.

![[Schema Carnot cycle|80%|center]]

1. $ab$ is constant [[temperature]] $T_{2}$ transformation that absorbs [[heat]] $Q_{2}$.
2. $bc$ is an [[adiabatic transformation]] that lowers temperature from $T_{2}$ to $T_{1}$.
3. $cd$ is another constant temperature $T_{1}$ transformation that emits heat $Q_{1}$.
4. $da$ is another adiabatic transformation that increases temperature from $T_{1}$ to $T_{2}$.

The work done by this cycle is $W=\Delta Q=Q_{2}-Q_{1}$. The [[thermal efficiency]] $\eta$ is
$$\eta=\frac{W}{Q_{2}}=1- \frac{Q_{1}}{Q_{2}}$$
If $W>0$, then $Q_{1}>0$ and $Q_{2}>0$. It is possible to reverse the cycle, thus having $W<0$ with $Q_{1}<0$ and $Q_{2}<0$.
