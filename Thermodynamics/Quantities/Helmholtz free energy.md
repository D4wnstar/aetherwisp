The **Helmholtz free energy** $A$ or $F$ is a measure of the energy of a system. It is defined as
$$A=U-TS$$
where $U$ is the [[internal energy]], $T$ is the [[temperature]] and $S$ is the [[entropy]]. Helmholtz free energy is particularly useful in systems that a constant temperature.
### Mechanically isolated system
For a mechanically [[Physical system|isolated system]] at constant temperature, $A$ never increases. In fact, from the [[Laws of thermodynamics|second law of thermodynamics]] we get
$$\int_{A}^{B} \frac{dQ}{T}\leq S(B)-S(A)\equiv \Delta S\quad\Rightarrow \quad \frac{\Delta Q}{T}\leq \Delta S$$
(to pull $T$ out of the integral it must be constant). From the [[Laws of thermodynamics|first]] we get
$$\Delta Q=\Delta U+W\quad\Rightarrow \quad W\leq-\Delta U+T\Delta S=-\Delta A$$
For a reversible transformation we get $W=-\Delta A$. But in a mechanically isolated system we have $W=0$, therefore
$$0\leq-\Delta A \quad\Rightarrow \quad \Delta A\leq 0$$
In other words, for a system of constant temperature, $A$ can only decrease. Thus the most stable state (i.e. lowest energy state) is the one where $A$ is lowest. The equilibrium is reached because the internal energy has a tendency to stabilize the system, whereas entropy tends to make it more disorderly and eventually balance each other out.

> For a mechanically isolated, constant temperature system, a state of equilibrium is achieved when $A$ is minimized.
