The **Gibbs free energy** or **Gibbs thermodynamic potential** $G$ is a measure of energy of a system. It is defined as
$$G=A+PV=U-TS+PV$$
where $A$ is the [[Helmholtz theorem]], $P$ is the [[pressure]], $V$ is the volume, $U$ is the [[internal energy]], $T$ is the [[temperature]] and $S$ is the [[entropy]].
### Constant temperature and pressure
For a system with constant pressure and temperature, $G$ never increases. In fact, from Helmholtz free energy we get
$$W\leq-\Delta A\qquad W=PV\qquad P\Delta V+\Delta A\leq 0\qquad \Delta G\leq 0$$
Thus the most stable state (i.e. lowest energy state) is the one where $G$ is lowest.

> For a system with constant temperature and pressure, a state of equilibrium is achieved when $G$ is minimized.
