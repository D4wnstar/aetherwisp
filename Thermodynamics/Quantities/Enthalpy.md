**Enthalpy** is a form of thermodynamic energy defined as
$$H=U+PV=(c_{V}+Nk_{b})T$$
where $U$ is the [[internal energy]], $P$ is [[pressure]], $V$ is volume, $c_{V}$ is the [[specific heat]] by volume, $N$ is the number of [[particella|particles]], $k_{B}$ is the [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann constant]] and $T$ is [[temperature]].
