**Heat capacity** or **thermal capacity** $C$ is the amount of [[heat]] $Q$ that needs to be absorbed by a body to incur a unit change in [[temperature]] $T$, such that
$$C=\lim_{ T \to 0 } \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta T}=T \frac{ \partial S }{ \partial T } $$
where $S$ is [[entropy]]. It is an [[extensive property]], with more massive objects having more heat capacity, though it the quantity varies greatly depending on the [[thermodynamic state]] of the body and is better represented as the function $C(P,T)$, with $P$ [[pressure]] and $T$ temperature. The entropy-dependent formula is a convenient way to measure entropy differences experimentally, as we can see by inverting the formula:
$$\Delta S=\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} \frac{C(T)}{T}dT$$
With an experimental [[Parameter estimation|fit]] of $C(T)$, we can perform consistency tests on the theory.

The heat capacity also depends on the kind of [[thermodynamic transformation]] that's applied onto the body. Different types of transformations are usually denoted with a subscript: $C_{V}$ for constant volume ones, $C_{P}$ for isobaric ones, etc.
