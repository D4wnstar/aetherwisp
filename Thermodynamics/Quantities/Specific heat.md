The **specific heat (capacity)** $c$ of a substance is the amount of [[heat]] $Q$ that needs to be absorbed by a unit amount of matter to incur a unit change in [[temperature]] $T$. The amount of matter can be determined by several variables, namely the amount of [[Particle|particles]] $N$, the [[mass]] $M$ or the volume $V$. It is defined starting from the [[heat capacity]] $C$:
$$\begin{align}
c_{N}&=\frac{C}{N}\,=\frac{1}{N}\lim_{ T \to 0 } \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta T} \\
c_{M}&=\frac{C}{M}=\frac{1}{M}\lim_{ T \to 0 } \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta T} \\
c_{V}&=\frac{C}{V}\;=\frac{1}{V}\lim_{ T \to 0 } \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta T}
\end{align}$$
