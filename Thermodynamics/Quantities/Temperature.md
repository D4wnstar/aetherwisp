**Temperature** is the physical quantity that quantitatively describes the idea of "how hot" a body is. From a physical perspective, it is a macroscopic, averaged measure of the [[kinetic energy]] of all [[Particle|particles]] comprising a body, usually [[molecule|molecules]] and/or [[Atom|atoms]]. Scientifically, the temperature scale used to quantify temperature is given by thermodynamic's [[absolute temperature]], which is independent of substance. Notably, it also shows the presence of a lower bound for temperature, called the [[Absolute temperature|absolute zero]], which cannot be reached (but may be approached).
