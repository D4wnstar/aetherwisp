**Heat** $Q$ is the transfer of energy from one body to another due to a difference in [[temperature]] between the two. It is a macroscopic quantity that abstracts away the complexity of the actual microscopic interactions, which are transfers of kinetic energy due to collisions between individual [[atomo|atoms]] and [[molecule|molecules]]. Heat is not energy per se, as much as it is the transfer of energy from one place to another. A body therefore never "contains" heat, but it may absorb and emanate it.

An amount of heat $\Delta Q$ absorbed by a body causes a rise $\Delta T$ in its temperature given by
$$\Delta Q=C\Delta T$$
where $C$ is the [[heat capacity]] of the body.
