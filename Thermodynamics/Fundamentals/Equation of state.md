The **equation of state** of a [[physical system]] in [[thermal equilibrium]] is a function that takes a system's thermodynamic, macroscopic variables as arguments and constrains them. This is usually [[pressure]], volume and [[temperature]]:
$$f(P,V,T)=0$$
The actual form of $f$ depends on the substance. $f$ is regarded as continuous and [[Differential|differentiable]], expect at most at special points.

The equation of state leaves only two of the three variables independent and it can be represented as a [[Surface|surface]] in three dimensional [[Phase space|phase space]]. The system is then constrained to this surface. [[Thermodynamic transformation|Reversible transformations]] can be represented as [[Curve|curves]] that lie on this surface, whereas irreversible transformations lie anywhere in space, except fully on the surface, or may not be representable at all[^1]. Moreover, intermediate points in irreversible transformations do not have uniform values for variables and cannot therefore be represented as points in space.

[^1]: For instance, removing a wall from the container of a gas, letting it expand in a region of space that was previously unreachable and void, wouldn't be representable.
