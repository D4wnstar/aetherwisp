**Thermal equilibrium** is the state a [[physical system]] is in when it has no net flow of [[heat]] to other physical systems despite them being connected by a path permeable to heat. In other words, a system is in thermal equilibrium when it isn't isolated but also transfers no heat. The process of reaching thermal equilibrium is called **thermalization**.

If a body is in thermal equilibrium, its thermodynamic variables are not independent of each other. They are related by the body's [[equation of state]].
