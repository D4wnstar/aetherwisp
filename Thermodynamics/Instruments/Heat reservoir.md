A **heat reservoir** is a body so large, [[heat]] exchange with other bodies incurs no noticeable variation in its [[temperature]]. It can seen as a body with massive [[heat capacity]], at least with respect to the amount of heat being transferred.

They're commonly employed to complete [[Thermodynamic transformation|isothermal transformations]] on a body by keeping that body in contact with the reservoir. If the transformation is slow enough, the body and reservoir will remain in [[thermal equilibrium]] all throughout, but since the variation of the reservoir's temperature is negligible due to its massive heat capacity, the body will also not change temperature.
