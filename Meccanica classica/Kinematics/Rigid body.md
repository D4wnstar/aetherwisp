A **rigid body** is a solid body that cannot be deformed. Given any two points on the object, the distance in between them remains the same at all times. The [[center of mass]] of a rigid body always remains in the same place with respect to the body's points. A rigid body can be either a system of [[particella|particles]] or a continuum of mass.
