The **power set** (or **powerset**) $\mathcal{P}(S)$ of a [[set]] $S$ is the [[set]] of all of its possible [[subset|subsets]], including the [[empty set]] $\emptyset$ and $S$ itself.

For example, the power set of $\{ 1,2,3 \}$ is
$$\{ \emptyset, \{ 1 \}, \{ 2 \}, \{ 3 \}, \{ 1,2 \}, \{ 1,3 \}, \{ 2,3 \}, \{ 1,2,3 \} \}$$
