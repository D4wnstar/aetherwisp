A **probability mass function** is a function associated with a discrete [[random variable]] that gives the probability that the variable, when measured, is exactly equal to some value. The function is strongly linked to the [[probability distribution]] that the variable follows, and is in fact the primary means of defining the distribution in the first place.

Formally, given a discrete random variable $X$, its probability mass function $p_{X}$ is defined as $p_{X}:\Omega_{X}\to[0,1]$, where $\Omega_{X}$ is $X$'s [[sample space]]. It is equal to
$$p_{X}(x)=P(X=x)$$
where $P$ is a [[measure]] of [[probability]]. By definition of probability, the total probability must be 1:
$$\sum_{x \in \Omega}p_{X}(x)=1 $$
