The **vacuum permittivity** or **permittivity of free space** $\varepsilon_{0}$ is a dimensional constant that binds the [[electric charge]] to mechanical quantities like [[force]]. In SI units it is
$$\varepsilon_{0}=8.854\times10^{-12}\text{ F}/\text{m}$$
It is related to the [[vacuum permeability]] and the [[speed of light]] by
$$c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ \varepsilon_{0}\mu_{0} }}$$
