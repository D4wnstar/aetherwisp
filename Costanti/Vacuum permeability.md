The **vacuum permeability** or **permeability of free space** $\mu_{0}$ is a dimensional constant that binds the magnetic phenomena to mechanical quantities like [[force]] through [[electric current]]. In SI units it is
$$\mu_{0}=4\pi \times 10^{-7}\ \frac{\text{N}}{\text{A}^{2}}$$
This value used to be empirically determined, but the value was so close to exactly the one above that during a reform it was arbitrarily set to the exact value above, instead allowing the value of the [[vacuum permittivity]] vary to satisfy their connection to the [[speed of light]]:
$$c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ \varepsilon_{0}\mu_{0} }}$$
