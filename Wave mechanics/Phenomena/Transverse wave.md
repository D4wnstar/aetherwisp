A **transverse wave** is a [[wave]] whose oscillation is [[Orthogonality|perpendicular]] to the direction of propagation. Mathematically, the axis of oscillation is the orthogonal to the [[Wavenumber|wavevector]]. The most typical example is [[electromagnetic wave|electromagnetic waves]], which are coupled oscillating [[Electric field|electric]] and [[Magnetic field|magnetic fields]]. In three dimensions, there are infinite possible perpendicular axes to the propagation, so there is a certain freedom in what direction the transverse wave can oscillate in. It may oscillate chaotically in no particular axis or it may have a preferred axis; in the latter case, the axis is called the [[polarization]] vector.

They are one of two categories of wave motion, the other being [[longitudinal wave|longitudinal waves]].
