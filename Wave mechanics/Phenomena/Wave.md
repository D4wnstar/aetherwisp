A **wave** is an oscillation of a physical quantity around a rest value over a region of space and over time. The wave may move across space like a radio wave, in which case it is known as a [[traveling wave]], or oscillate in place like a guitar string, in which case it is known as a [[standing wave]]. The most common kinds of waves are [[mechanical wave|mechanical waves]], deformations of a medium by repeated compression and decompression like sound waves or water waves, and [[electromagnetic wave|electromagnetic waves]], coupled oscillating [[Electric field|electric]] and [[Magnetic field|magnetic fields]] like light or radio waves.

The behavior of a wave can be modeled mathematically by numerous equations. The most important among them is the aptly-called [[wave equation]], which has historically laid the foundation of the study of waves, starting from linear, [[Dispersion|nondispersive]] ones. Other equations have been developed to study more complicated processes, like dispersion and nonlinearity, either by extending the original wave equation or by starting from a completely different origin (such as the [[Schr√∂dinger equation]]).
