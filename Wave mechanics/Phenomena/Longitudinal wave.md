A **longitudinal wave** is a [[wave]] whose oscillation is parallel to the direction of propagation. Mathematically, the axis of oscillation is the parallel to the [[Wavenumber|wavevector]]. The most typical example is [[acoustic wave|acoustic waves]], which are repeated compression and decompression of a solid material (usually air or water). When talking about mechanical waves specifically, such as acoustic waves, they are also called **compression waves**.

They are one of two categories of wave motion, the other being [[transverse wave|transverse waves]].
