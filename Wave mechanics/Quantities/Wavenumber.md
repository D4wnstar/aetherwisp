The **wavenumber** of a [[wave]] is its spatial frequency. It can be seen as the number of peaks (or valleys) the wave has per unit distance. It is the spatial equivalent of temporal [[frequency]]. It can be given in two different forms:
- the **ordinary wavenumber** is measured in $\text{cycles}/\text{m}$ (or other unit of distance) and is denoted $\tilde{\nu}$ or $h$;
- the **angular wavenumber** is measured in $\text{rad}/\text{m}$ (or other unit of distance) and is denoted $k$. This is the form that is always used in physics.

The two are related by $k=\tilde{\nu}/2\pi$. It is typical in physics to always refer to angular wavenumber, even without specifically mentioning "angular". They are related to the [[wavelength]] by $\lambda=1/\tilde{\nu}$ and $\lambda=2\pi/k$.

For waves in more than one dimension, the **wavevector** $\mathbf{k}$ is a [[Vector space|vector]] that describes the direction of propagation of the wave. The modulo of the wavevector is the wavenumber, $\lvert \mathbf{k} \rvert=k$.
