The **phase velocity** of a [[wave]] is one of two definitions of its velocity, the other being [[group velocity]]. It is the velocity at which the [[phase]] of a single-[[frequency]] component of the wave propagates in space. Imagine fixing a point on the profile of the wave so that its [[amplitude]] never changes: the velocity at which that point propagates is the phase velocity.

The phase velocity is only well-defined on waves with a single frequency component, that is monochromatic waves. Consider a [[Plane wave|monochromatic plane wave]] of [[Frequency|angular frequency]] $\omega$ and [[wavenumber]] $k$ (equivalently, [[Wavenumber|wavevector]] $\mathbf{k}$ of [[norm]] $\lvert \mathbf{k} \rvert\equiv k$). Its phase velocity is
$$v_{p}=\frac{\omega}{k}=\frac{\lambda}{T}$$
where $\lambda$ and $T$ are the [[wavelength]] and [[period]]. If the wave is composed of multiple layered frequencies, each of them will have its own phase velocity. The speed of the wave as a whole is then described by [[group velocity]].

An animation displaying the difference between phase velocity (green) and group velocity (red). Note how the green point never goes "up" or "down", i.e. it doesn't change amplitude. That means its phase is constant, and therefore shows the propagation of the phase.
