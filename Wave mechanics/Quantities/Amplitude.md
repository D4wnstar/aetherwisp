The **amplitude** of a periodic variable such as a [[Wave]] is the variation of that variable over an entire [[period]]. The physical interpretation of an amplitude is entirely dependent on the interpretation of the wave itself, but in general, it is loosely seen as the "intensity" of the wave, although the term "intensity" can be very ambiguous.
