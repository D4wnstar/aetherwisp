The **group velocity** of a [[wave]] is one of two definitions of its velocity, the other being [[phase velocity]]. It is the velocity at which the [[envelope]] of the wave propagates in space. It is most easily seen in the motion of a [[wave packet]], where the shape of the envelope is quite obvious.

The concept of group velocity only makes sense for waves composed of multiple [[frequency|frequencies]]. It is defined as
$$v_{g}=\frac{ \partial \omega(k) }{ \partial k } $$
where $\omega(k)$ is the [[dispersion|dispersion relation]] between angular frequency $\omega$ and [[wavenumber]] $k$. Since in monochromatic waves the dispersion relation is $\omega=v_{p}k$, the group velocity is just the phase velocity:
$$v_{g}=\frac{ \partial (v_{p}k) }{ \partial k } =v_{p}$$

A wave packet showing different phase and group velocity. In this case, the phase velocity is higher.

An animation displaying the difference between phase velocity (green) and group velocity (red). Note how the wave is comprised many smaller waves (wave packets), divided by the green points. These packets move with different velocity compared to the [[phase]]. This is the group velocity.
