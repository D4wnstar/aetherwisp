The **frequency** of an oscillatory phenomenon is the amount of oscillations it completes per unit time. For instance, in a [[simple pendulum]], it can be interpreted as the number of swings it completes in a second or in a minute. It can be given in two different forms:
- the **ordinary frequency** is measured in $\text{cycles}/\text{s}$ or $\text{Hz}$ (or other unit of time) and is denoted $\nu$ or $f$;
- the **angular frequency** is measured in $\text{rad}/\text{s}$ (or other unit of time) and is denoted $\omega$.

The two are related by $\omega=\nu/2\pi$.
