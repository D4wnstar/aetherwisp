A **phasor** is the complex [[phase]] of a [[Plane wave|sine wave]] of constant [[Frequency|angular frequency]] and time-invariant [[amplitude]]. Given a complex sine wave
$$\psi(x,t)=Ae^{i[\mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{r}-\omega t+\varphi]}$$
where $\omega$ is constant, the term
$$Ae^{i\varphi}$$
is called the phasor of the wave.

The name comes from the portmanteau of "phase" and "vector", but it is a bit of a misnomer. Phasors are not vectors: their set does not form a [[vector space]]. However, some properties of vectors do apply, most important of which is that they sum in the same way as vectors. This allows for greatly simplified calculation of wave superposition as operations that would be quite complicated in non-phasor notation become relatively simple algebraic equations when in phasor notation.
