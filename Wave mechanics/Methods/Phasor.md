A **phasor** is a complex function representing a sinusoidal function through [[Euler's formula]]. In general, it is the constant part of a function of the form
$$\psi(t)=Ae^{i(\omega t+\varphi)}=\underbrace{ Ae^{i\varphi} }_{ \text{phasor} }\ \cdot e^{i\omega t}$$
for some real constant $A$. The [[real and imaginary parts|real part]] of this function is the sinusoid:
$$\mathrm{Re}(\psi(t))=A\cos(\omega t+\varphi)$$
It is commonly used when studying [[wave]] phenomena, where $A$ is interpreted as the [[amplitude]] of the wave, $\varphi$ as the [[phase]] and $\omega$ as the [[angular frequency]]. Since phasors are constant by definition, all three of the previous values must be constant. Sinusoids with a variable amplitude, phase or frequency cannot be represented as phasors.

The name comes from the portmanteau of "phase" and "vector", although it is a bit of a misnomer. Phasor are not true vectors and their set does not form a [[vector space]]. However, some properties of vectors do apply: most importantly they sum in the same way as vectors.
