The **frequency** of an oscillatory phenomenon is the amount of oscillations it completes per unit time. For instance, in a [[simple pendulum]], it can be interpreted as the number of swings it completes in a second or in a minute. It is typically represented in one of two units:
- when measured in inverse seconds, $s^{-1}$ or equivalently $\text{Hz}$, it is simply known as "frequency", denoted $\nu$ and is the number of cycles per second;
- when measured in $\text{rad}/s$ it is known as **angular frequency**, denoted $\omega$ and is the number of full rotations completed in a second.

Angular frequency is more common in physics.
