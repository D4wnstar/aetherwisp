A **harmonic** is a [[Plane wave|sine wave]] whose [[Frequency|angular frequency]] is an integer multiple of another sine wave, called the **first harmonic**. Calling $\omega$ the frequency of the first harmonic (the **fundamental frequency**), all harmonics have frequency $n\omega$, where $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and $n\neq 0$.

Similarly, if we call $\lambda$ the [[wavelength]] of the first harmonic, subsequent frequencies will be $\lambda/n$. The [[series]] of all wavelengths forms a [[harmonic series]], hence the name.
