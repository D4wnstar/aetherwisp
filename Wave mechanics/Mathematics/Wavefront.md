The **wavefront** is the locus of all points in space (generally a [[surface]]) where a [[wave]] has equal [[phase]]. If, for a given time, the [[amplitude]] is determined exclusively by the phase, the wavefront is a constant amplitude surface.

For the concept of wavefront to make sense, there must be a rigorous definition of phase, which is usually only true for [[Plane wave|sine waves]].
