A **spherical wave** is a [[wave]] whose [[wavefront]] is a [[sphere]] everywhere. It is the solution to the [[Helmholtz equation]] in [[spherical coordinates]]. Like all waves, a spherical wave can be seen as a [[plane wave]] for small enough areas of the wavefront, especially at large distances, just like how the surface of a sphere is locally a [[plane]].
