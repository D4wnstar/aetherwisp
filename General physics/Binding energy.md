The **binding energy** of a [[physical system]] is the [[energy]] required to remove one of its components. It is typically denoted with the letter $B$. The larger the binding energy is, the more energy needs to be transferred to break a piece off the system, hence the name. It is found in many fields of physics in different forms.
## Nuclear binding energy
The difference between the [[mass]] of the system as a whole (the [[atomic nucleus]]) and that of the individual components (the nucleons), is called the **mass defect**. Using the [[Relativistic energy|mass-energy equivalence]] $E=m_\text{defect}c^{2}$ on the defect gives us the binding energy of the system.

It is convenient to express the nuclear binding energy in terms of [[atom|atomic]] masses, as they are measurable with much better precision ($\sim10^{-6}$) than nuclear masses using [[mass spectrometry]]. This way, the binding energy is
$$B(Z,A)=[Zm(\ce{^{1}H})+Nm_{n}-m(Z,A)]c^{2}$$
where
* $A$, $N$ and $Z$ are the [[Atom|atomic mass number]], [[Atom|neutron number]] and [[Atom|atomic number]].
* $m_{n}$ is the mass of the [[neutron]].
* $m(\ce{^{1}H})=m_{e}+m_{p}$ is the mass of the [[hydrogen atom]], with $m_{e}$ and $m_{p}$ being the masses of the [[electron]] and the [[proton]].
* $m(Z,A)$ is the mass of an atom with electrons and $A$ nucleons.
* $c$ is the [[speed of light]].

Essentially, this formula measures the difference between the mass of the atom and the mass the system would have if it were composed of separate hydrogen atoms and neutrons.

The term **separation energy** is sometimes preferred over binding energy when referring to the removal of [[Atomic nucleus|nucleons]]. The **neutron separation energy** $S_{n}$ is the energy required to remove a neutron from a nucleus, i.e., the binding energy difference between $\ce{_{Z}^{A}X_{N}}$ and $\ce{_{Z}^{A-1}X_{N-1}}$:
$$S_{n}=B(\ce{_{Z}^{A}X_{N}})-B(\ce{_{Z}^{A-1}X_{N-1}})=[m(\ce{_{Z}^{A-1}X_{N-1}})-m(\ce{_{Z}^{A}X_{N}})+m_{n}]c^{2}$$
The **proton separation energy** $S_{p}$ is defined in a similar manner:
$$S_{p}=B(\ce{_{Z}^{A}X_{N}})-B(\ce{_{Z-1}^{A-1}X_{N}})=[m(\ce{_{Z-1}^{A-1}X_{N}})-m(\ce{_{Z}^{A}X_{N}})+m(\ce{^{1}H})]c^{2}$$

The binding energy of a nucleus depends on its atomic mass number $A$. One might expect the ratio of binding energy to the number of nucleons to be constant, but this is not the case.

$B$ increases sharply for the first few atoms (up to $A\simeq20$), after which it begins to flatten out and decline with a slight slope. The vast majority of nuclei reside in a relatively narrow band, ranging from 7.2 to 8.8 MeV/nucleon ($8.0\pm0.8$ MeV/nucleon). The only elements not included in this band are the very light ones, with $A<10$, such as hydrogen and helium. The peak of energy per nucleon is at $A\sim60$, where the nuclei are evidently particularly bound. In particular, iron $\ce{^{56}Fe}$ is a particularly resistant nuclide.

This plot gives us information on which process is energetically viable to release energy:
1. For $A\lesssim 60$, it is more efficient to combine nuclei together through [[nuclear fusion]].
2. For $A\gtrsim60$, it is more efficient to break nuclei to create smaller ones through [[spontaneous fission]].

The breaking point of these processes is around $A\sim60$. For example, nuclear fusion cannot create nuclei heavier than iron ($A=56$) without external energy input.
