The **fundamental interactions** or **fundamental forces** are the most elementary forces of the Universe, in the sense that they are not reducible to more elementary components. In the modern [[Universe]] there exist four of them:
1. [[Gravity]]
2. [[Electromagnetism]]
3. [[Strong interaction]]
4. [[Weak interaction]]

Three of these are said to be **exchange interactions**, which is to say that they act by exchanging discrete quanta in the form of [[Particle|particles]] known as [[gauge boson|gauge bosons]]. These are [[Photon|photons]] for electromagnetism, [[gluon|gluons]] for strong interaction and [[W boson|W]] and [[Z boson|Z bosons]] for weak interaction. As such, these interactions are understood as a part of quantum mechanics.

The remaining interaction, gravity, is only understood outside of quantum physics. The modern theory of gravity is Einstein's theory of general relativity, in which it is the curvature of [[spacetime]] that enacts the force. The explanation of gravity as a quantum phenomenon and the potential discovery of the quantum of gravity (the so-called *graviton*) is one of the largest unsolved mysteries of modern physics.

Comparison between fundamental interactions requires a common ground, namely a set of dimensionless constants that represent the "strength" of the force with respect to the others, called **[[coupling constant|coupling constants]]**. The definition of this constant changes for each force and is partially a matter of convention as they all rely on a reference quantity. Either way, the physically significant values are the *ratios* of the constants, which are independent of convention provided the same convention is applied to all of them. These are
$$10^{-39}\text{ gravity} < 10^{-5}\text{ weak} < 10^{-2}\text{ electromagnetic} < 1\text{ strong}$$
This is the general hierarchy of interactions. Strong is aptly named for being the strongest, followed by electromagnetism, weak and finally gravity. You'll notice massive differences in orders of magnitude, especially between gravity and the others. The reason why such a colossal jump in strength exists between gravity and weak force is currently not understood and is known as the [[hierarchy problem]].
