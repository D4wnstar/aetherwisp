**Radiation** is the process by which [[energy]] is transferred from one location to another by a [[wave]] or a [[Particella|particle]][^1]. The most common kinds of radiation are [[electromagnetic radiation]], [[particle radiation]] due to [[Decadimento nucleare|nuclear]] or [[Decadimento di particelle|particle decay]], [[acoustic radiation]] such as [[sound]] and [[gravitational radiation]] through [[Spaziotempo|spacetime]].

[^1]: The two coincide in quantum physics.
