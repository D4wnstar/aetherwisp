**Radiation** is the process by which [[energy]] is transferred from one location to another by a [[Wave]] or a [[Particella|particle]][^1]. An object that emits radiation is said to **radiate**. The most common kinds of radiation are [[Electromagnetic radiation]], [[particle radiation]] due to [[Decadimento nucleare|nuclear]] or [[Decadimento di particelle|particle decay]], [[acoustic radiation]] such as [[sound]] and [[gravitational radiation]] through [[Spacetime|spacetime]].

[^1]: The two coincide in quantum physics.
