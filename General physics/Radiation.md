**Radiation** is the process by which [[energy]] is transferred from one location to another by a [[wave]] or a [[Particle|particle]][^1]. The end location could possibly be infinitely far away An object that emits radiation is said to **radiate**. The most common kinds of radiation are [[electromagnetic radiation]] due to the acceleration of an [[electric charge]], [[particle radiation]] due to [[Nuclear decay|nuclear]] or [[Particle decay|particle decay]], [[acoustic radiation]] such as [[sound]] and [[gravitational radiation]] through [[Spacetime|spacetime]].

[^1]: The two coincide in quantum physics.
