A **particle** is an object that occupies a localized region of [[spacetime]] and possesses certain intrinsic attributes, such as [[mass]], [[electric charge]] or [[spin]].

Particles are typically used as an idealization within a physical model in order to simplify treatment. For instance, in statistical mechanics an [[ideal gas]] is described as being composed of numerous particles, irrespective of the shape, size and specifics of the actual atoms and [[Molecule|molecules]] that make up the gas, in order to treat them as a large set of equivalent objects. In general, a particle is assumed to be an object that is much smaller than the scale of the environment that it is in.
### In particle physics
In particle physics, the term refers to objects smaller than an [[atom]], so-called **subatomic particles**. These may be of two kinds:
- **Elementary particles** have no internal components and are not made of other particles. Examples include the [[electron]], any [[neutrino]] or the [[photon]].
- **Composite particles** are composed of other particles, usually elementary ones. Examples include the [[proton]] and the [[neutron]], both made of three [[Quark|quarks]] each.

Whereas we are aware of a large number of composite particles, there are only few elementary ones. Our current understanding of elementary particles is formalized in the **[[Standard Model]]** of particle physics, which is a model containing all 17 known elementary particles, their known properties and how they behave with respect to [[electromagnetism]], the [[weak interaction]] and the [[strong interaction]].
#### Proof of elementarity
The elementarity of a particle of size[^1] $d$ can be proven experimentally. This is generally done by shining a strong light onto the particle and analyzing its response. More formally, the particle is illuminated with an [[electromagnetic wave]] whose [[wavelength]] $\lambda$ satisfies
$$\lambda\lesssim d$$
as in, the wavelength is smaller than the size scale of the object. This allows probing the internal structure of the particle, if there is any. Note the challenge with this: smaller wavelengths are associated with higher [[Frequency|frequencies]]. The [[Planck formula]] says $E=\hbar\omega$, so higher frequencies mean higher [[energy|energies]] and thus the tinier the object to investigate, the more energy will need to be channeled into the wave to study. This poses a not insignificant technical challenge since subatomic particles are generally minuscule, in the range of $10^{-15}\text{ m}$ or even less, so the energies can easily reach
$$E=\hbar \omega=\hbar ck=\hbar c \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\sim \hbar c \frac{2\pi}{d} \sim 1\text{ GeV}$$
the [[Electronvolt|gigaelectronvolt]] range.

[^1]: The meaning of size is intentionally left unspecified, as "size" at quantum scales is not a well-defined concept.
