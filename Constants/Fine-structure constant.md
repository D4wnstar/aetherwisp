The **fine-structure constant** $\alpha$, also known as the **electromagnetic coupling constant**, is the dimensionless constant that determines the strength of the [[electromagnetic interaction]]. It is given by
$$\alpha=\frac{e^{2}}{4\varepsilon_{0}\hbar c}=\frac{1}{137.03\ldots}$$
where
- $e$ is the [[elementary charge]].
- $\hbar$ is the [[Planck constant|reduced Planck constant]].
- $c$ is the [[speed of light]].
- $\varepsilon_{0}$ is the [[vacuum permittivity]].

The exact value of the constant is not an integer, but unless precision is needed, $\alpha\equiv1/137$ is commonly used since it's easy to remember and is $\sim0.03$ away from the actual value.
