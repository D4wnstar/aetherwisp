The **gravitational constant** $G$, also known as **Newton's constant**, is the constant that determines the [[Interazione gravitazionale|gravitational interaction]] between to [[mass|massive]] bodies:
$$\begin{align}
G&=6.67\times10^{-11}\ \text{Nm}^{2}/\text{kg}^{2} \\
&=6.67\times10^{-39}\ \hbar c \frac{c^{4}}{\text{GeV}^{2}} \\
&=1.541\times10^{âˆ’6}\ \frac{\text{R}_{\oplus }^{3}}{\text{M}_{\oplus }s^{2}} 
\end{align}$$
