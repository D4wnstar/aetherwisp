The **Planck constant** $h$ is a constant originally introduced in Planck's attempt to solve [[black body]] [[radiation]]. In SI units it is approximately equal to
$$h=6.626\times10^{-34}\ \text{J}\cdot\text{s}$$
The **reduced Planck constant** is also used:
$$\hbar=\frac{h}{2\pi}=1.054572\times10^{-34}\ \text{J}\cdot\text{s}$$
Besides the extremely small value, the Planck constant has the dimensions of an [[angular momentum]]. This is important because it is the fundamental unit of [[spin]] for subatomic [[Particle|particles]].
