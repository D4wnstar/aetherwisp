The **Bohr radius** $a_{0}$ is a constant representing the distance from the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of a [[hydrogen atom]] at which the [[funzione d'onda|wave function]] of an [[electron]] in the ground state has maximum [[probability]].

It is defined as
$$a_{0}=\frac{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}\hbar^{2}}{e^{2}m_{e}}=\frac{\hbar}{m_{e}c\alpha}=5.29177210903(80)\times10^{âˆ’11}\text{ m}\simeq0.53\ \mathring{\text{A}}$$
where
- $\hbar$ is the [[Planck constant|reduced Planck constant]]
- $\varepsilon_{0}$ is the [[vacuum permittivity]]
- $e$ is the [[elementary charge]]
- $m_{e}$ is the [[electron|electron mass]]
- $c$ is the [[speed of light]]
- $\alpha$ is the [[fine-structure constant]]

It was originally discovered through the [[Bohr model]] of the hydrogen atom as the orbit radius of an electron in the ground state. A more precise value can be obtained by solving the Bohr model without assuming that the nucleus is stationary. This leads to the **modified Bohr radius**
$$a_{\mu}=\frac{m_{e}}{\mu}a_{0}$$
where $\mu=m_\text{nucleus}m_{e}/(m_\text{nucleus}+m_{e})$ is the reduced mass of the hydrogen atom.
