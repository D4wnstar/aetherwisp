The **Bohr radius** $a_{0}$ is a constant representing the distance from the [[Nucleo atomico|nucleus]] of a [[hydrogen atom]] at which the [[funzione d'onda|wave function]] of an [[electron]] in the ground state has maximum [[probability]].

It is defined as
$$a_{0}=\frac{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}\hbar^{2}}{e^{2}m_{e}}=\frac{\hbar}{m_{e}c\alpha}=5.29177210903(80)\times10^{âˆ’11}\text{ m}$$
where
- $\hbar$ is the [[Planck constant|reduced Planck constant]]
- $\varepsilon_{0}$ is the [[vacuum permittivity]]
- $e$ is the [[elementary charge]]
- $m_{e}$ is the [[electron]] [[mass]]
- $c$ is the [[speed of light]]
- $\alpha$ is the [[fine-structure constant]]

It was originally discovered through the [[Bohr model]] of the hydrogen atom as the orbit radius of an electron in the ground state.
