The **Boltzmann constant** $k_{B}$ is a physical constant that commonly appears in thermodynamics and relates [[energy]] with [[temperature]]:
$$\begin{align}
k_{B}=\frac{R}{N_{A}}&=1.38\cdot10^{-23}\text{ J/K}\\
&=1.38\cdot10^{-16}\text{ erg/K}\\
&=8.62\cdot10^{5} \text{eV/K}
\end{align}$$
where $R$ is the [[ideal gas constant]] and $N_{A}$ is the [[Avogadro number]].

It is generally used in statistical mechanics, but it is occasionally employed in nuclear and particle physics to give a sense of scale for the energies found in those domains. This is done by arbitrarily converting between energy and temperature with $E=k_{B}T$. Here's some examples:
- room temperature ($\sim 300\text{ K}$) shows energies in the order of $\sim 10^{-2}\text{ eV}$, which is tiny.
- the center of the sun ($\sim 10^{7}\text{ K}$) gets around $\sim 1\text{ keV}$.
- the [[Rydberg constant|Rydberg energy]] ([[potential energy]] of the ground state of the [[hydrogen atom]], $13.6\text{ eV}$) gets about $\sim 10^{5}\text{ K}$.
- modern collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN can reach $\sim 10\text{ TeV}$, which is about $\sim 10^{17}\text{ K}$. That's ten billion times the temperature of the core of the Sun!

Remember that temperature is only well-defined in complex systems with many interactions, such as macroscopic [[matter]], so these numbers are just to give a sense of scale. Take them with a grain of salt.
