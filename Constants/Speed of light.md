The **speed of light** $c$ is the speed of a ray of light in the vacuum. In SI units it is exactly equal to
$$c=299\ 792\ 458\text{ m/s}$$
by definition. What a "ray of light" constitutes depends on the branch of physics, but in general it is the speed at which [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic interaction]] is communicated between different objects. In classical physics, it is the propagation speed of an [[electromagnetic wave]]. In quantum physics, it is the velocity of a [[photon]]. It is related to the [[vacuum permittivity]] $\varepsilon_{0}$ and the [[vacuum permeability]] $\mu_{0}$ by
$$c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ \varepsilon_{0}\mu_{0} }}$$
In nuclear and atomic physics, it is sometimes useful to express the square of speed of light in terms of [[Electronvolt|electronvolts]] and [[atomic mass unit|atomic mass units]]:
$$c^{2}=931.494\text{ MeV/u}$$
This is useful when converting from atomic masses to atomic [[Relativistic energy|rest energies]] with $E=mc^{2}$.
