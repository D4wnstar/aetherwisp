The **Rydberg constant** $R$ is a constant that appears in nuclear and atomic physics, particularly in the [[Bohr model]] of the atom. In terms of other fundamental constants, it is given by
$$R_{\infty}=\frac{m_{e}}{4\pi c\hbar^{3}}\left(\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\right)^{2}=109737\text{ cm}^{-1}$$
in the approximation of an infinitely massive [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nucleus]]. If we set the nuclear mass to some finite constant $M$ and define the reduced mass as $\mu=m_{e}M/(m_{e}+M)$, a more precise value for the constant is given by
$$R_{\mu}=\frac{\mu}{m_{e}}R_{\infty}$$
Depending on the form it is given in, the Rydberg constant can be interpreted in one of a few ways. In inverse length ($\text{cm}^{-1}$), it represents the inverse [[wavelength]] (i.e. [[wavenumber]]) that all [[Riga spettrale|spectral lines]] of the [[hydrogen atom]] are a multiple of. The inverse of $R$ in this form is known as the [[Lyman limit]]:
$$\frac{1}{R}\simeq 911\ \mathring{\mathrm{A}}$$
In this sense, it can also be given as a [[frequency]] by multiplying by the [[Speed of light]] $c$:
$$\bar{R}=cR=3.288\cdot10^{15}\text{ Hz}$$
Recognizing that $hcR$ is an energy (because of the [[Planck formula]]) we can write the **Rydberg energy**
$$E_\text{Ryd}=hcR\simeq13.6\text{ eV}$$
This represents the depth of the [[potential]] well in which an [[electron]] resides in the ground state of the hydrogen atom. In other words, it is the [[ionization]] energy of hydrogen in the ground state.

Experimental measurements on the atom yield values of $R=109677\text{ cm}^{-1}$, almost identical to the theoretical value, confirming that the Bohr model is fairly accurate, despite being classical.
