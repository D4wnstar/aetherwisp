The **law of cosines** relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. For a triangle with sides $a$, $b$ and $c$, opposite respective angles $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$, we have
$$\begin{align}
c^{2} & =a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\cos \gamma \\
a^{2} & =b^{2}+c^{2}-2bc\cos \alpha \\
b^{2} & =a^{2}+c^{2}-2ac\cos \beta
\end{align}$$
For a right triangle, where $\gamma=0$, this reduces to the **Pythagorean theorem**: $c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}$.
