A **state transition**, in quantum mechanics, is the transition of a [[Particle]] from one [[Stationary state|energy eigenstate]] to another, which may be higher or lower [[energy]]. During a transition to a higher energy state, the particle must absorb energy from a source (for example, an incident [[photon]]); conversely, when transitioning to a lower energy state, the particle must emit the excess energy, usually in the form of a photon. The absorbed or emitted energy is always equal to the difference in energy between the states: calling $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ the initial and final state energies, the transferred energy is
$$E_{\text{transferred}}=-\Delta E=E_{i}-E_{f}$$
