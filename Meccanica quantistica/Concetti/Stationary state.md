A **stationary state** is a quantum [[stato|state]] in which all [[osservabile|observables]] are independent of time. Stationary states are [[Equazione agli autovalori|eigenstates]] of the [[Hamiltonian]] [[operatore|operator]]. For this reason, they are often referred to as **energy eigenstates** or **energy eigenkets**.

Stationary states are solutions to the [[Equazione di Schrödinger|time-independent Schrödinger equation]]
$$\hat{H}|\Psi\rangle=E |\Psi\rangle$$
where $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, $|\Psi\rangle$ is the system's state, and $E$ is the energy eigenvalue associated with the stationary state.

The first two graphs show stationary states of the [[oscillatore armonico quantistico|quantum harmonic oscillator]] (ground state and first excited state), while the third is a linear combination of the first two states: $\psi_{N}=(\psi_{0}+\psi_{1})/\sqrt{2}$. The orange and blue components are the [[real and imaginary parts]] of the [[wave function]], respectively. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_state).
