The **Lyman limit**, or **Lyman break**, is a [[wavelength]] of approximately 912 Ã… associated with the [[energy]] required by an [[electron]] in the ground state of the [[hydrogen atom]] to overcome the [[potential]] barrier that [[Stati in meccanica quantistica|binds]] it to the [[Nucleo atomico|nucleus]]. This energy is equal to the [[Rydberg constant]], i.e., 13.6 [[Elettronvolt|eV]].
