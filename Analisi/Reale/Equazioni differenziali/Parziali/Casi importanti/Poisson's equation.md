**Poisson's equation** is the [[equazione differenziale parziale|partial differential equation]]
$$\nabla^{2}\psi=f$$
where $\nabla^{2}$ is the [[Laplacian|Laplacian]] and $f$ is a complex valued function over a [[manifold]]. It is a more general form of [[Laplace's equation]]. It can be solved generally using a [[Green's function]]:
$$\psi(\mathbf{r})=-\iiint \frac{f(\mathbf{r}')}{4\pi|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}d\mathbf{r}'$$
where the integration happens over all space.
