**Laguerre's differential equation** is a second order linear [[ordinary differential equation]] of a function $x(t)$:
$$t \frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}+(1-t) \frac{dx}{dt}+nx=0$$
It has nonsingular solution only for $n\in \mathbb{N}$, and those solutions are the [[Laguerre polynomials]]. This equation can be generalized to
$$t \frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}+(\alpha+1-t) \frac{dx}{dt}+nx=0$$
for some $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$. Nonsingular solutions to this equation are known as the associated Laguerre polynomials.
