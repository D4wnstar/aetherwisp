A [[Serie|series]] is said to **converge absolutely** if the series made of the absolute values of each term also converges:
$$\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} x_{i}\text{ converges absolutely if }\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} |x_{i}|\text{ also converges}$$
The same definition can be extended to improper integrals:
$$\int_{0}^{+\infty}f(x)\ dx\text{ converges absolutely if }\int_{0}^{+\infty}|f(x)|\ dx\text{ also converges}$$
