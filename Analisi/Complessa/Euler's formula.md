**Euler's formula** is an equation in complex analysis that allows one to convert between trigonometric functions and complex exponentials. It states
$$e^{i\theta}=\sin \theta+i\cos \theta$$
When $\theta=\pi$, it takes on a form known as **Euler's identity**:
$$e^{i\pi}=-1$$
This formula can be used to rewrite the sine and cosine as complex functions:
$$\sin \theta=\frac{e^{i\theta}-e^{-i\theta}}{2i},\qquad \cos \theta=\frac{e^{i\theta}+e^{-i\theta}}{2}$$
