Given a set of [[Vector space|vectors]] $v_{1},\ldots v_{n}$, the vectors are said to be **linearly independent** if there does not exists a nontrivial [[linear combination]] of them that is equal to zero. In other words, there does not exists a set of constants $\alpha_{1},\ldots,\alpha_{n}\in \mathbb{R}$, not all zero, such that
$$\alpha_{1} v_{1}+\ldots+\alpha_{n}v_{n}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_{i}v_{i}=0$$
If such a set exists, the vectors are instead **linearly dependent**. If two vectors $v$ and $w$ are linearly dependent, one is always a multiple of the other, which means that there exists a constant $c\in \mathbb{R}$ for which $v=cw$.
