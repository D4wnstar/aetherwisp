Given two elements $v$ and $w$ of a space equipped with a [[scalar product]] $(v,w)$, the two elements are said to be **orthogonal** or **perpendicular** if their scalar product is zero, that is
$$(v,w)=0$$
Typically, the space in question is a [[vector space]] and its elements are vectors. A more advanced definition is the orthogonality of two functions belonging to an infinite-dimensional space, such as a [[Hilbert space]].
