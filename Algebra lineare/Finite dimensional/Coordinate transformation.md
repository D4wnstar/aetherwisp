A **coordinate transformation** is an invertible [[linear map]], specifically a [[diffeomorphism]], between a real [[vector space]] and itself, defined in general as $\varphi:\mathbb{R}^{N}\to \mathbb{R}^{N}$, $x\to x'=f(x)$. The vectors $x$ and $x'$ are different sets of coordinates for the same space.

They are primarily used to change between different systems of coordinates
### Examples
Most coordinate transformations involve going from [[Cartesian coordinates]] to another set of coordinates and viceversa. For instance, when going from [[spherical coordinates]] to Cartesian coordinates, the mapping is
$$\varphi:\mathbb{R}^{3}\to \mathbb{R}^{3},\qquad \varphi(\rho,\theta,\phi)=(\rho\cos\theta\sin\phi,\rho\sin\theta\sin\phi,\rho\cos\phi)=(x,y,z)$$
or from [[polar coordinates]] to Cartesian
$$\varphi:\mathbb{R}^{2}\to \mathbb{R}^{2},\qquad \varphi(r,\theta)=(r\cos \theta,r\sin \theta)=(x,y)$$
