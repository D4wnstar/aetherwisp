A **convex combination** is a special kind of [[linear combination]] where all of the coefficients are non-negative and their sum is one. Mathematically, it reads
$$\alpha_{1}v_{1}+...+\alpha_{n}v_{n}\quad\text{where}\quad \alpha_{1},\ldots,\alpha_{n}\geq 0\quad\text{and}\quad \alpha_{1}+\ldots+\alpha_{n}=1$$
These are common in [[probability]] theory (and by extension quantum mechanics), as the constraints on the coefficients are the same as the ones put on a set of probabilities, namely that probabilities must be non-negative and that they must sum to one.
