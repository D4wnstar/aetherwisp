A **dual vector space** $V^{*}$ is a special kind of [[vector space]] associated with another vector space $V$ and equipped with a linear function $a:V\to \mathbb{R}$. It is the space of all [[linear functional|linear functionals]] on $V$. It is composed of scalars derived from the vectors of $V$ using the function $a$:
$$V^{*}=\{ a:V\to \mathbb{R}\;|\; a(\alpha \mathbf{v}+\beta \mathbf{w})=\alpha a(\mathbf{v})+\beta a(\mathbf{w})\quad\forall \mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}\in V \}$$
The dimension of $V^{*}$ is the same as the dimension of $V^{*}$.

A **dual basis** $\{ \mathbf{e}_{1}^{*},\ldots,\mathbf{e}_{n}^{*} \}$ is a [[basis]] of $V^{*}$ composed elements such that $\mathbf{e}_{i}^{*}(\mathbf{e}_{j})=\delta_{ij}$, where $\mathbf{e}_{j}$ are elements of a basis of $V$.
