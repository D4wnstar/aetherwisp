The **identity operator** is an [[operatore|operator]] that always returns its argument. Applying the identity operator to an object does not result in any change. It is denoted as $\mathbf{1}$ or $\hat{\mathbf{1}}$. Given a [[scalar]] $c$ or another operator $T$, its application does nothing:
$$\mathbf{1}c=c,\qquad \mathbf{1}T=T$$
Because of this it is often omitted, but it is important to remember that it is still an operator. For example, the "$c$" above is, strictly speaking, an operator where the $\mathbf{1}$ is omitted. While this mostly does not matter in practice, it is relevant when dealing with operations that return operators, such as the [[Commutator]] of two [[Osservabile|observables]] in quantum mechanics. For instance, in the well-known canonical commutation relation $[\hat{q},\hat{p}]=i\hbar$, the right hand side is actually an operator: $[\hat{q},\hat{p}]=i\hbar \hat{\mathbf{1}}$.
