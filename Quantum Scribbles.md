Hello, welcome to Quantum Scribbles! This is a large (currently >270.000 words) collection of all of the notes that I take for my courses in university. It's mostly physics, but there might be adjacent topics and in the future there will likely be a considerable amount of computer science and HPC-related topics once I get to my master's degree.

As of writing this, there are over 700 articles organized in an ideally understandable manner. The quality of the notes progressively got better and better over time, as I learnt to write proper educational text in real time while simultaneously listening to professors and reading the many equations on the blackboard. Also, writing LaTeX in real time is hard even with tons of automation. Many of the articles that you read here are essentially still first drafts. I of course go back on my notes when studying and do edit my writing to be better, but it's time consuming and it's often not my priority when exams are coming up, so mistakes can absolutely be present!

Despite being organized in a very similar manner, I am by no means making an attempt to replace Wikipedia or textbooks, of course. The amount of work needed to do would be enormous, but I still hope that someone might find these pages useful. In the future, I'd like to make bibliography pages containing the sources I've used to write these notes, which are for the most part either established textbooks or my own professors' notes. Most of the articles are in English, as I fully expect my master's degree to be taught in English, but some older sections are still in Italian. I may or may not translate them to English in the future.
#### FAQ
**Q.** Who are you?

**A.** I am Samuele Vignoli, a physics student at the University of Trieste. I have a website [here](https://personal-website-one-topaz-29.vercel.app/) if you're curious about me, and a [Github profile](https://github.com/D4wnstar) if you want to know more about the things that I spend my time with instead of studying like a responsible student.

**Q.** Why publish these?

**A.** To be honest, mostly because I can. Over time I've grown progressively more and more interested in public-facing work and the popularization of science and while I have no intention of becoming a professor, I figure I would do my part in this regard. I also believe that science should be freely accessible to all, so that's why all of this is on the public internet and not behind a paywall. It's also an excuse to battle-test my unstable and currently-undocumented [Obsidian plugin](https://github.com/D4wnstar/wiki-generator) I made and published this whole website with.

**Q.** How do you write these?

**A.** These notes are all written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I use the [latex-suite](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite) plugin to make writing LaTeX 100 times easier, which is what allows me to take these in real time. I make the plots and diagrams with [obsidian-excalidraw](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin). The website is kept updated using my aforementioned [wiki-generator](https://github.com/D4wnstar/wiki-generator) plugin.

**Q.** I found a mistake!

**A.** Yeah, I can imagine. Feel free to send an email to `samvignoli@proton.me` if you want to notify me about it.

**Q.** LaTeX/Code/Formatting is broken!

**A.** As I said above, I continuously generate this website from my Obsidian notes using my own plugin. There's bound to be some bugs in the process, and some things that work well in Obsidian don't work so well here, so they tend to go unseen. I iron these out once I see them.
