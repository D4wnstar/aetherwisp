An **ammeter** is a tool used to measure [[electric current|electric currents]] within a circuit.
### Mechanism
Consider a circuit element traversed by current $I$ by charges ([[Elettrone|electrons]]) of [[electric charge]] $q$ moving at velocity $\mathbf{v}$.

Say this whole circuit is subject to a [[magnetic field]] $\mathbf{B}$ that is not necessarily aligned with the circuit's cross section (or even straight or uniform).

The circuit is embedded inside of an iron cylinder that's designed to [[Magnetization|magnetize]] and demagnetize in short periods (milliseconds). Whenever a current passes through the circuit, a [[Lorentz force]] is applied onto it, which is perpendicular to the circuit, which enacts a torque onto it, causing it to spin (it is intentionally not held in place).
