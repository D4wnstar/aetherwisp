A **dielectric** or **insulator** is a material in which all [[Electric charge|electric charges]] are attached to a specific [[Atomo|atom]] or [[molecule]] and cannot move far from it. There are no free charges.
### Behavior under an electric field
#### Atom
The simplest possible dielectric is a single atom, with a positively charged [[Nucleo atomico|atomic nucleus]] and a negatively charged [[Elettrone|electron]] cloud surrounding it. When subject to an [[electric field]], the nucleus and electron cloud move in opposite direction, as one is attracted by the field and the other is repelled. With a strong enough field, the electrons can be ripped from the nucleus, thus [[ionizzazione|ionizing]] the atom, but for milder fields, a state of equilibrium is reached.

The force keeping the nucleus and cloud together balances the one applied by the external field. In this state, the geometric center of the electron cloud, which acts as a sort of charge equivalent of the [[center of mass]], does not coincide with the (approximately point-like) nucleus. As such, the positive and negative charges of the atom are not superimposed and this turns the atom into an [[electric dipole]], with a (tiny) [[electric dipole moment]] that is typically proportional to the strength of the external field. Such an atom (or molecule) is said to be **polarized** and the dipole moment is modeled as
$$\mathbf{p}=\alpha \mathbf{E}$$
where $\mathbf{E}$ is the field and $\alpha$ is an atom-specific constant called the [[atomic polarizability]].
#### Molecules
In the case of molecules, the situation is more complicated, as the geometry of a molecule makes more easily polarized from a certain direction. In the case of a linear molecule, such as $CO_{2}$, the polarizability is highest on the molecule's axis. This complicates the induced moment's formula due to having to consider the components parallel and perpendicular to the axis:
$$\mathbf{p}=\alpha_{\perp}\mathbf{E}_{\perp}+\alpha_{\parallel}\mathbf{E}_{\parallel}$$
This may make the moment not even in the same direction of the field. For completely asymmetrical molecules, the polarizability splits in nine different components, one for every combination of axes. The object containing these components is called the **polarizability tensor** and is applied to the electric field:
$$\begin{pmatrix}
p_{x} \\
p_{y} \\
p_{z}
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}
\alpha_{xx} & \alpha_{xy} & \alpha_{xz} \\
\alpha_{yx} & \alpha_{yy} & \alpha_{yz} \\
\alpha_{zx} & \alpha_{zy} & \alpha_{zz}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
E_{x} \\
E_{y} \\
E_{z}
\end{pmatrix}$$

Some molecules are permanently polarized due to their geometry. These are called **polar molecules**.
