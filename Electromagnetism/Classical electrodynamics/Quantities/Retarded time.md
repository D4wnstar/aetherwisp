The **retarded time** is the time at which a signal was produced, as opposed to the time at which it is received. For an [[electromagnetic wave]], which travels at the [[speed of light]], it is
$$t_{r}\equiv t- \frac{\mathfrak{r}}{c}$$
where $t$ is the time of arrival and $\mathfrak{r}$ is the distance between the source and the receiver, under the assumption that it travels in a straight line.

It is also possibile to define the reverse, the **advanced time**, which only has a different sign:
$$t_{a}\equiv t+ \frac{\mathfrak{r}}{c}$$
This, however, is of little use in physics as it is fundamentally incompatible with the world we live for it breaks *[[causality]]*, the principle by which *cause* must precede *effect*. Where the advanced time to be used for anything (such as electrodynamic potentials), we'd have to accept the idea that what happens now is dependent not on what *was*, but on what *will be*[^1]. It makes for a wonderful concept in magic, but scarcely so in physics.

[^1]: For what it's worth, advanced time is actually perfectly valid in electrodynamics, since the [[d'Alembertian]] (and by extension the [[wave equation]]) is dependent on $t^{2}$ and is therefore [[Inversione temporale|time-reversal invariant]]. The choice not to allow it is entirely artificial and based off the fact that no such causality break has ever been encountered. For all purposes, electromagnetic signal propagate only forward in time, never backwards.
