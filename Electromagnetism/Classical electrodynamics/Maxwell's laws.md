**Maxwell's laws** are four equations that determine the [[divergence]] and [[curl]] of the [[Electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]. They are
$$\begin{align}
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E} & =\frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_{0}} &
\nabla\times\mathbf{E} & =\mathbf{0} \\
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B} & =\mathbf{0} &
\nabla\times\mathbf{B} &= \mu_{0}\mathbf{J}
\end{align}$$
and together with the boundary conditions $\mathbf{E}\to 0$ and $\mathbf{B}\to  0$ approaching infinity, they uniquely determine the two fields. $\rho$ is a volume [[electric charge]] density and $\mathbf{J}$ is a volume [[electric current]] density. $\varepsilon_{0}$ and $\mu_{0}$ are the [[Costante dielettrica del vuoto|permittivity]] and [[permeability of free space]] respectively.

They are equivalent to using [[Interazione elettromagnetica|Coulomb's law]] and the superposition principle (electrostatics) and the [[Biot-Savart law]] and the superposition principle (magnetostatics) combined. These laws, alongside the [[Lorentz force]], explain the entirety of electromagnetic phenomena.
