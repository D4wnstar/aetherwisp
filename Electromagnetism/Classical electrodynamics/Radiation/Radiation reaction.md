The **radiation reaction (force)** is the [[force]] an accelerating [[Electric charge|charged]] [[Particella|particle]] applies onto itself due to emission of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. It is also called **Abraham-Lorentz force** or **radiation damping force**. Assuming non-[[Lorentz transformation|relativistic]] speeds, where $v\ll c$, the reaction is
$$\mathbf{F}_\text{rad}=\frac{\mu_{0}q^{2}}{6\pi c}\dot{\mathbf{a}}$$
where $q$ is the [[electric charge]] of the particle, $c$ is the [[speed of light]] and $\dot{\mathbf{a}}$ is its [[jerk]], the time derivative of acceleration.
### Derivation
(TODO: Derivation done in class 16/04/2025 is identical to the one on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham%E2%80%93Lorentz_force#Derivation))
