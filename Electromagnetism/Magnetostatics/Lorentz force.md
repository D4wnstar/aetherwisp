The **Lorentz force** is the force applied onto an [[electric charge]] in the presence of both an [[Electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]. It is a more general case of [[Interazione elettromagnetica|Coulomb's law]], to which it goes back to if there is no magnetic field. It is
$$\mathbf{F}=Q[\mathbf{E}+(\mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{B})]$$
where $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity of the test charge $Q$.

If only a magnetic field is present, the law becomes $\mathbf{F}_\text{mag}=Q(\mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{B})$. This in an important distinction, as magnetic forces do no work as their application is always perpendicular to motion. In fact
$$dW_\text{mag}=\mathbf{F}_\text{mag}\cdot d\mathbf{r}=Q(\mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{B})\cdot \mathbf{v}dt=0$$
because $\mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{B}$ is always perpendicular to $\mathbf{v}$. The work is actually always carried out by the electric part of the force due to the charges having to move "counter-current" against the magnetic field. In this sense, a magnetic force just redirects an electric force, but it does not work itself, in the same way a normal force over a sloped surface redirects a force to push an object up but doesn't do work itself.
