The **magnetic potential** $V_{M}$, not to be confused with the [[magnetic vector potential]] $\mathbf{A}$, is a quantity introduced in the study of magnetic circuits as an analog of the [[electric potential]]. It is equal to the [[Integrale su una curva|path integral]] of the [[auxiliary field]] $\mathbf{H}$:
$$V_{M}=\int_{A}^{B}\mathbf{H}\cdot d\mathbf{r}$$
