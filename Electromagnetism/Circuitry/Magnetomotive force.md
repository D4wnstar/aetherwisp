The **magnetomotive force** (or **mmf** for short) $\mathcal{F}$ is the magnetic analog of [[electromotive force]], used in [[magnetic circuit|magnetic circuits]]. It is measured in amperes. It is typically produced by a coil of $N$ turns carrying [[electric current]] $I$, which simply gives
$$\mathcal{F}=NI$$
It is also connected to [[Hopkinson's law]] by
$$\mathcal{F}=\Phi_{B}\mathcal{R}$$
where $\Phi_{B}$ is the magnetic [[flux]] and $\mathcal{R}$ is the [[magnetic reluctance]]. In the specific case of a solenoid or toroid of mean length or circumference $l$, it can be found from the [[auxiliary field]] directly:
$$\mathcal{F}=Hl$$
