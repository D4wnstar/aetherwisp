The **Joule effect** is the phenomenon whereby an [[electric current]] traversing a material produces heat, the amount of which is dependent on the intensity of the current. For an ohmic perfect resistor of [[electrical resistance]] $R$ subject to a current $I$ and an [[electric potential]] difference $\Delta V$,  the power output in heat is
$$P=I\Delta V=RI^{2}=\frac{V^{2}}{R}$$
where the last two forms are derived with [[Ohm's law]]. If the element is not a perfect resistor, only the first relation is true.
### Derivation
Consider any piece of a circuit subject to an [[electric potential]] difference $\Delta V$ and traversed by a current $I$. In a time $dt$, the piece is traversed by an [[electric charge]] $dq=Idt$, so the work done by the [[electric field]] here is $dW=\Delta Vdq=I\Delta Vdt$. Since power is the time derivative of work, we have
$$P=\frac{dW}{dt}=I\Delta V$$
If the piece is a perfect resistor, that is, 100% of the energy passing through it gets dissipated in the form of thermal energy, we can apply [[Ohm's law|Ohm's first law]]:
$$P=RI^{2}$$
For a perfect resistor, the total power *is* the heat power output, as opposed to an imperfect resistor where only a fraction of the power is converted.
