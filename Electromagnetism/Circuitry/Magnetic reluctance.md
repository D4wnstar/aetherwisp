The **magnetic reluctance** $\mathcal{R}$ is the magnetic analog of the [[electrical resistance]], as used in [[magnetic circuit|magnetic circuits]]. It represents resistance against magnetic [[flux]], just like how electrical resistance represent resistance against [[electric current]]. It is measured in inverse henries, $\text{H}^{-1}$. The reluctance of a uniform magnetic circuit of cross-section $A$, length $l$, [[permeability]] $\mu_{r}$ is
$$\mathcal{R}=\frac{l}{\mu_{0}\mu_{r} A}$$
where $\mu_{0}$ is the [[Vacuum permeability]].

Reluctances in series sum:
$$\mathcal{R}_\text{series}=\mathcal{R}_{1}+\mathcal{R}_{2}$$
Reluctances in parallel sum their reciprocals:
$$\frac{1}{\mathcal{R}_\text{parallel}}=\frac{1}{\mathcal{R}_{1}}+ \frac{1}{\mathcal{R}_{2}}$$

The key difference between the reluctance and resistance is that reluctances do not cause dissipation of [[energy]]. There is no "magnetic [[Joule effect]]", so to speak. As such, the analogy between the two should not be used when discussing energy conservation.
