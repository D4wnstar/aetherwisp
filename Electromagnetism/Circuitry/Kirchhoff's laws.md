**Kirchhoff's laws** are two empirical laws that describe the behavior of [[electric current]] and [[electric potential]] differences within circuits. They are consequences of the conservation of [[electric charge]] and the [[conservative force|conservative]] nature of the [[electric field|electrostatic field]] respectively, and rely on the direction of current within the wire.
### Kirchhoff's junction law
**Kirchhoff's first law**, or **Kirchhoff's junction law**, states that the total directed sum of currents passing through a [[junction (circuit)|junction]] is always zero:
$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} I_{i}=0$$
By directed we mean that the sign of each current is plus if it is ingoing and negative if it is outgoing. In other words, the sum of entering currents in equal to the sum of exiting currents.
### Kirchhoff's loop law
**Kirchhoff's second law**, or **Kirchhoff's loop law**, states that the total directed sums of potential differences over a closed loop is always zero:
$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} \Delta V_{i}=0$$
By directed we mean that $\Delta V$ is positive if $V$ increases across a point or component and negative if it decreases.
