**Kirchhoff's laws** are two empirical laws that describe the behavior of [[electric current]] and [[electric potential]] differences within circuits. They are consequences of the conservation of [[electric charge]] and the [[conservative force|conservative]] nature of the [[electric field|electrostatic field]] and heavily rely on the direction of current within the wire.
### Kirchhoff's junction law
**Kirchhoff's first law**, or **Kirchhoff's junction law**, states that the total directed sum of currents passing through a [[junction (circuit)|junction]] is always zero:
$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} I_{i}=0$$
In other words, the sum of entering currents in equal to the sum of exiting currents.
### Kirchhoff's hoop law
**Kirchhoff's second law**, or **Kirchhoff's hoop law**, states that the total directed sums of potential differences over a closed loop is always zero:
$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} \Delta V_{i}=0$$
