A **magnetic circuit** is a closed loop of magnetic [[flux]], similarly to how an electric circuit is a closed loop of [[electric current]]. Magnetic flux is guided through the use of materials with very high [[permeability]], which keep the flux contained within the material until it meets a dead-end, in which case it travels through air (or the vacuum). Since magnetic field lines are always closed (due to the [[Divergence]] of the [[magnetic field]] always being zero), magnetic circuits are always closed.
### Component analogies
Magnetic circuits are easiest to understand by comparing them to more familiar electrical circuits.
- Current becomes magnetic flux.
- Batteries that emit an [[electromotive force]] become coils traversed by a current wrapped around the material and produce a [[magnetomotive force]].
- [[Electrical resistance|Resistances]] becomes [[Magnetic reluctance|magnetic reluctances]].
- [[Electric potential]] becomes [[magnetic potential]].
- [[Kirchhoff's laws]] have their own magnetic versions.
