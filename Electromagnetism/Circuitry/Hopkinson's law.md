**Hopkinson's law** is a magnetic analog of [[Ohm's law]] in the context of magnetic circuits. It connects the magnetic [[flux]] $\Phi_{B}$ of the circuit with its [[magnetic potential]] $V_{M}$ through the [[magnetic reluctance]] $\mathcal{R}$:
$$V_{M}=\mathcal{R}\Phi_{B}$$
Like in Ohm's law, the potential is more correctly the [[magnetomotive force]] of the circuit.
