**Thomson's experiment** is a method of calculating the [[Elettrone|electron]]'s charge-to-mass ratio. It won Thomson the Nobel prize in physics.
### Setup
Consider a vacuum tube (a cathode ray tube) equipped with an electron cannon. In front of the cannon there are two parallel charged (distance $D$) plates that produce a local [[electric field]] ($E=V_{d}/D$). The entire tube is under the effect of a uniform [[magnetic field]] that is perpendicular to the electric field. The two fields deviates the path of the electrons shot from the cannon according to the [[Lorentz force]]
$$\mathbf{F}=e\mathbf{E}+e(\mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{B})$$
We want the total force to be zero, so we can delete one variable. If the force is zero, the electron will go straight from the cannon, with no curvature. For this to happen, we need
$$\frac{eV_{d}}{D}+evB=0$$
If we choose the directions of the fields cleverly, we can ignore the minus sign
$$\frac{V_{d}}{D}=vB$$
If we take the square we get
$$\frac{V_{d}^{2}}{D^{2}}=v^{2}B^{2}=B^{2} \frac{2eV_{e}}{m_{e}}$$
From which we can extract the charge-to-mass ration $e/m_{e}$.
