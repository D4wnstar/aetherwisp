The **electric susceptibility** $\chi_{e}$ is a dimensionless constant of proportionality associated with a type of [[dielectric]] material that describes the intensity of [[dielectric polarization]] in response to an external [[electric field]]. The greater the susceptibility, the greater the polarization. It is combined with the [[Vacuum permittivity|permittivity of free space]] to determine the material's [[permittivity]].

The value of $\chi_{e}$ depends on the microscopic structure of the material, as well as external factors like temperature. For a more general case, it's possible in some material that the value $\chi_{e}$ depends on the direction too. Such materials are said to be **anisotropic** with respect to polarization. In this case, the susceptibility is described by the **susceptibility [[tensor]]**:
$$\begin{pmatrix}
\chi_{xx} & \chi_{xy} & \chi_{xz} \\
\chi_{yx} & \chi_{yy} & \chi_{yz} \\
\chi_{zx} & \chi_{zy} & \chi_{zz}
\end{pmatrix}$$
