**Electric charge**, often simply just **charge**, is the physical property of a [[particella|particle]] that causes it exhibit [[Interazione elettromagnetica|electromagnetic interaction]]. It may be positive, negative or zero. A particle with zero electric charge is said to be electrically neutral. Charges of different type annihilate each other, in the sense that their effects cancel each other out.

Charge is a conserved quantity. It cannot be created or destroyed. The net total charge in the Universe is constant. This fact is called **global conservation of charge**. Another, more strict, phenomenon is **local conservation of charge**, which means that if a charge where to move from place A to place B, it must follow a continuous path in between the two. This means that a charge cannot simply vanish alongside an equal and opposite charge on the other side of the [[Galassia|galaxy]], despite that being allowed by global conservation. The two charges must "touch" in order to annihilate.

Charge is quantized and the fundamental unit of charge is the [[Carica elementare|charge of the electron]] $e$.
