**Electric displacement** $\mathbf{D}$ is a [[Campo vettoriale|vector field]] that accounts for the electromagnetic effects of both the [[electric field]] generated by [[dielectric polarization]] and an external electric field. It is defined as
$$\mathbf{D}=\varepsilon_{0}\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{P}$$
where $\varepsilon_{0}$ is the [[Costante dielettrica del vuoto|vacuum permittivity]], $\mathbf{E}$ is the external field and $\mathbf{P}$ is the polarization. Unlike $\mathbf{E}$, there is no "[[Interazione elettromagnetica|Coulomb's law]]" for displacement as the [[curl]] of $\mathbf{D}$ is not necessarily zero:
$$\nabla\times\mathbf{D}=\nabla\times\mathbf{P}$$
It is only zero if the polarization is irrotational, and it usually isn't. An example case is when the external charge density is zero, that is, there is no external field.
### Gauss' law
It obeys a form of [[Gauss' law]] that is similar to that of the electric field
$$\nabla\cdot\mathbf{D}=\rho_{f},\qquad \oint \mathbf{D}\cdot d\mathbf{a}=Q_{f,enc}$$
in both differential and integral forms. $\rho_{f}$ is the free charge density (the one responsible for the external field) and $Q_{f,enc}$ is the total [[electric charge]] of $\rho_{f}$ enclosed within the Gaussian surface.
### Boundary conditions
As the displacement is dependent on the electric field, it inherits the discontinuity over surface charges. From the integral form of Gauss' law we get
$$D_\text{above}^{\perp}-D_\text{below}^{\perp}=\sigma_{f}$$
and from the curl of $D$ we get
$$\mathbf{D}_\text{above}^{\parallel}-\mathbf{D}_\text{below}^{\parallel}=\mathbf{P}_\text{above}^{\parallel}-\mathbf{P}_\text{below}^{\parallel}$$
When dealing with dielectrics, these may be more meaningful than the boundary conditions on the electric field itself.
