The **electric dipole moment** $\mathbf{p}$ is a measure of how separated positive and negative [[Electric charge|electric charges]] are within a system. A dipole moment is defined for any pair of charges within a system, that is, for each [[electric dipole]], and the total moment of the system is the sum of each dipole moment. For a system of point charges, it is defined as
$$\mathbf{p}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} q_{i}\mathbf{r}_{i}'\qquad[\text{C m}]$$
where $q_{i}$ is $i$-th charge and $\mathbf{r}'_{i}$ is the position vector of that charge. For a physical dipole where charges are $\pm q$ it is
$$\mathbf{p}=q\mathbf{d}$$
where $\mathbf{d}$ is the vector going from the negative charge to the positive charge.
### Origin dependency
Notice the important fact that the dependency is on the *position* vector, not explicitly the distance between any two charges. Of course, it can *become* the distance, as seen in the physical dipole, but the only strict necessity to have a dipole is for the charge to not be at the origin point. In fact, a sole point charge $q$ (a monopole) can have a dipole moment too
$$\mathbf{p}=q\mathbf{r}'$$
where $\mathbf{r}'$ is its position with respect to the origin. This means that the choice of origin can drastically alter the dipole moment of a system. If the total charge is zero, however, dipole moment is origin-independent.

Suppose that we displace the origin by an amount $\mathbf{a}$, the new dipole moment is
$$\tilde{\mathbf{p}}=\int \tilde{\mathbf{r}}'\rho(\mathbf{r}')\ d\tau'=\int(\mathbf{r'}-\mathbf{a})\rho(\mathbf{r}')\ d\tau'=\int \mathbf{r}'\rho(\mathbf{r'})\ d\tau'-\mathbf{a}\int \rho(\mathbf{r}')\ d\tau'=\mathbf{p}-Q\mathbf{a}$$
If $Q=0$, then the moment does not change.
