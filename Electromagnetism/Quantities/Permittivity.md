The **permittivity** $\varepsilon$ is a measure of the response of a [[dielectric]] material when subject to an [[electric field]]. Specifically, it is used to determined the [[dielectric polarization]] of the material. In the simplest case of linear dielectrics it is
$$\varepsilon=\varepsilon_{0}(1+\chi_{e})$$
where $\varepsilon_{0}$ is the [[Costante dielettrica del vuoto|permittivity of free space]] and $\chi_{e}$ is the [[electric susceptibility]]. The term *permittivity of free space* actually itself comes from this definition, as it is the permittivity when susceptibility is zero, that is, when there is no [[materia|matter]] to polarize. This may lead to the idea that the vacuum is just a type of dielectric, but that is not the case. The behavior of the vacuum is complex and requires quantum field theory to appreciate completely.

As an aside, the value $1+\chi_{e}$ is also called the **relative permittivity** $\varepsilon_{r}$.
