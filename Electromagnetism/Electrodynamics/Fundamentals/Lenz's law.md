**Lenz's law** is a rule to predict the orientation and sign of an induced [[electric field]]. It states:

> [!info] Lenz' law
> The direction of an induced electric field is always the one that cancels out the change in magnetic flux.

In other words, if a magnetic field is passing through a loop and somehow changing, the induced electric field will produces an [[electric current]] that flows in whatever direction is necessary to make a magnetic field directly opposing the original one. The actual magnitude of the induced field is usually tiny; Lenz's law only tells where it goes, not how much of an effect it has.

 In a way, this can be interpreted as inertia. A conducting loop wants to maintain a constant flux in time. If any change occurs, the loop will make an attempt to cancel that change out. It's a sort of [[Newton's laws|Newton's first law]] for magnetic flux.
