**Transition radiation** is a form of [[electromagnetic radiation]] that is emitted when an [[electric charge]] with [[Lorentz transformation|relativistic]] speed crosses ("transitions") from one medium to another. [[boundary condition|Boundary conditions]] and the difference in [[Permittivity|permittivity]] lead to a burst of radiation. The [[irradiance]] is
$$I=\frac{1}{3}\alpha \hbar \omega_{p}\gamma$$
where $\hbar$ is the [[Planck constant|reduced Planck constant]], $\alpha$ is the [[fine-structure constant]], $\gamma$ is the relativistic gamma and
$$\hbar \omega_{p}=\sqrt{ \frac{4\pi \alpha n_{e}}{m_{e}} }$$
$n_{e}$ is the material's [[electron]] density and $m_{e}$ is the mass of the electron. This value is generally measured in [[Electronvolt|electronvolts]]. For instance, 20 eV is a realistic value.

Transition radiation can be useful to measure the speed of a [[particle]] crossing materials by measuring $I$ and then inverting for $\gamma$.
