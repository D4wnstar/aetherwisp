The **radiation reaction (force)** is the [[force]] an accelerating [[Electric charge|point charge]] applies onto itself due to emission of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. It is also called **Abraham-Lorentz force** or **radiation damping force**. Assuming non-[[Lorentz transformation|relativistic]] speeds, where $v\ll c$, the reaction is
$$\mathbf{F}_\text{rad}=\frac{\mu_{0}q^{2}}{6\pi c}\dot{\mathbf{a}}$$
where $q$ is the charge, $c$ is the [[speed of light]] and $\dot{\mathbf{a}}$ is its [[jerk]], the time derivative of acceleration.
### Derivation
Conservation of [[energy]] demands that all energy being radiated by an accelerating charge is removed from somewhere else. That somewhere can only be the [[kinetic energy]] of the charge, meaning that a radiating particle accelerates *less* that if it didn't radiate, or equivalently less than a neutral particle. Basically, radiating energy enacts a sort of force back on the charge itself, which dampens the acceleration: we call this the **radiation reaction** and it is a sort of recoil force.

For a nonrelativistic particle, $v\ll c$, the total [[radiant power]] radiated is given by the [[Larmor formula]]:
$$P=\frac{\mu_{0}q^{2}a^{2}}{6\pi c}$$
As mentioned before, this energy has got to go *somewhere*, so all this energy is removed from the fields that the charge generates. But which fields? We know from the [[Li√©nard-Wiechert potentials]] that an accelerating point charge has not one, but *two* fields attached to it, the velocity and acceleration fields. The Larmor formula is derived from the radiation of the acceleration field, as that's the only one that actually causes radiation to be emitted. It does therefore miss a piece: the velocity field is still energy and still needs to be counted to avoid accidentally tearing a hole in conservation of energy. The velocity and acceleration fields constantly interchange energy as the particle accelerates and decelerates. Some of that energy is lost by radiation (Larmor formula), but other is lost by other ways. Were we to figure out the force by only the Larmor power, we'd be missing a piece. The energy lost in any given time interval must therefore be the one lost to Larmor power, *plus* the one transferred to the velocity field[^1].

If we consider a time interval in which the system returns to its initial state, the energy in the velocity field start and ends the same and the only overall loss is due to radiation. In this context, we *can* use the Larmor formula to state that it is generated by some force $\mathbf{F}_\text{rad}$ such the energy lost is
$$U=\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\mathbf{F}_\text{rad}\cdot \mathbf{v}dt=- \frac{\mu_{0}q^{2}}{6\pi c}\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}a^{2}dt$$
assuming that the system is in identical states at $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$. In other words, we're working with periodic motion and must integrate over full cycles. The integral is solved with [[integration by parts]]:
$$\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}a^{2}dt=\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt}\cdot \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt}dt=\left.{\left( \mathbf{v}\cdot  \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} \right)}\right|_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}-\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} \frac{d^{2}\mathbf{v}}{dt^{2}}\cdot \mathbf{v}dt$$
The boundary term drops thanks to the assumption the state is identical at $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$. We can now write the energy loss as
$$U=\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\mathbf{F}_\text{rad}\cdot \mathbf{v}dt=- \frac{\mu_{0}q^{2}}{6\pi c}\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\dot{\mathbf{a}}\cdot \mathbf{v}dt\quad\Rightarrow \quad \int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\left( \mathbf{F}_\text{rad}- \frac{\mu_{0}q^{2}}{6\pi c}\dot{\mathbf{a}} \right)\cdot \mathbf{v}dt=0$$
This is certainly true if
$$\boxed{\mathbf{F}_\text{rad}=\frac{\mu_{0}q^{2}}{6\pi c}\dot{\mathbf{a}}}$$
This is known as the **Abraham-Lorentz formula** for radiation reaction. Sort of, at least. As it stands, this formula is on thin ice. It is valid only in a very particular form of motion (perfectly periodic) and we don't really have any information on the components of $\mathbf{v}$ that are [[Orthogonality|perpendicular]] to $\mathbf{v}$ as those will get deleted by the [[scalar product]] anyway and therefore never matter in the integral. The actual proof of this form is available, but not with this premise; see [[#Mechanism]] below.

What's more urgent is the consequences of this law. Take [[Newton's laws|Newton's second law]]:
$$F_\text{rad}=\frac{\mu_{0}q^{2}}{6\pi c}\dot{a}=ma$$
under the assumption that the charge is not subject to any other force. This is a first-order linear [[ordinary differential equation]] with a simple exponential solution[^2]:
$$a(t)=a_{0}e^{t/\tau}$$
where
$$\tau\equiv \frac{\mu_{0}q^{2}}{6\pi mc}$$
If you don't intuitively catch the problem, allow me to make you notice that this is the acceleration of the charge, which is increasing *exponentially*, by *itself*, with *no* external force. This is called a **runaway solution** and has been studied extensively due to its absurdity. As it happens, you can just pretend these don't exist by arbitrarily setting $a_{0}=0$, but you do, you'll just catch yourself in an arguably even worse problem, which is that if you do, whenever an external force *is* applied, the particle ends up responding *before* the force is applied by a time $\tau$, in what is evidently a nonsensical phenomenon called **acausal preacceleration**. This is the point where I'd like to tell you that there's a niche, specific claim hidden somewhere that we can make to just delete the problem altogether, much in the same way we do with [[Retarded potentials|advanced potentials]]. I have no such claim. Not even relativity solves it, and we don't really know if quantum physics does. Either, there's something broken here and we don't know what, though it may something to do with point charges specifically (extended distributions don't have this issue) and/or with a flaw in the classical non-quantum theory specifically.
### Mechanism
If the radiation reaction is generated by the fields acting back on the charge, then there must be some way to calculate this force from the fields themselves. The issues is that fields blow up at point charges, so actually calculating the force seems unreasonable. To solve the issue, we'll instead use a charge distribution, so that there are no singularities in the fields, then take the limit so that the volume of the distribution goes to zero. The important part here is to look at [[Newton's laws|Newton's third law]] and the reactions within internal pieces of the distribution. In general, the electromagnetic force between two elements $A$ and $B$ of the distribution do not balance each other out, in that the force from $A$ to $B$ is not equal and opposite to the force from $B$ to $A$. If you integrate over all the distribution, you'll then be left with a residual internal force that is never fully cancelled out: a **self-force**. It is this self-force (and the corresponding failure of Newton's third law) that causes the radiation reaction.

For the sake of simplicity, in order to calculate this imbalance we'll use a shape of this sort:

![[Diagram Radiation reaction mechanism]]

The charge distribution is two "blobs" of charge, each containing half of the total charge, separated by a distance $d$. These of course move over time to incur the radiation reaction. Of course, this is not really a realistic model, but it does exhibit the behavior that we are looking for and does so in a simple manner. When $d\to 0$ we return to a point charge and we get the Abraham-Lorentz formula again.

Say the charges are instantaneously at rest ($\mathbf{v}=0$) at the retarded time. The electric field on $(1)$ due to $(2)$ is
$$\mathbf{E}_{1}=\frac{q/2}{4\pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{\mathfrak{r}}{(\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{r}}\cdot \mathbf{u})^{3}}[(c^{2}+\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{r}}\cdot \mathbf{a})\mathbf{u}-(\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{r}}\cdot \mathbf{u})\mathbf{a}]$$
where $\mathbf{u}=c \hat{\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{r}}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{r}}=l \hat{\mathbf{x}}+d \hat{\mathbf{y}}$ so that $\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{r}}\cdot \mathbf{u}=c\mathfrak{r}$, $\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{r}}\cdot \mathbf{a}=la$ and $\mathfrak{r}=\sqrt{ l^{2}+d^{2} }$. We're only interested in the $x$ component, since the $y$ component will cancel out when we add the forces on the two ends (same goes for the magnetic forces). We have $u_{x}=cl/\mathfrak{r}$, so
$$E_{1,x}=\frac{q}{8\pi \varepsilon_{0}c^{2}} \frac{lc^{2}-ad^{2}}{(l^{2}+d^{2})^{3/2}}$$
The system is symmetrical, so $E_{1,x}=E_{2,x}$, so the net force must be
$$\mathbf{F}_\text{self}=\frac{q}{2}(\mathbf{E}_{1}+\mathbf{E}_{2})=\frac{q^{2}}{8\pi \varepsilon_{0}c^{2}} \frac{lc^{2}-ad^{2}}{(l^{2}+d^{2})^{3/2}}\hat{\mathbf{x}}$$
We now want to expand in powers of $d$, as when the charge's size goes to zero, all positive powers of $d$ will go to zero. Using a [[Taylor series]] about $t_{r}$ the position becomes
$$x(t)=x(t_{r})+\dot{x}(t_{r})(t-t_{r})+ \frac{1}{2}\ddot{x}(t_{r})(t-t_{r})^{2}+ \frac{1}{3!}\dddot{x}\,(t_{r})(t-t_{r})^{3}+\ldots$$
By defining $T\equiv t-t_{r}$ for brevity, we have
$$l=x(t)-x(t_{r})=\frac{1}{2}aT^{2}+ \frac{1}{6}\dot{a}T^{3}+\ldots$$
$T$ is determined by the retarded time condition
$$(cT)^{2}=l^{2}+d^{2}$$
so that
$$d=\sqrt{ (cT)^{2}-l^{2} }=cT\sqrt{ 1- \left( \frac{aT}{2c}+ \frac{\dot{a}T^{2}}{6c}+\ldots \right)^{2} }=cT- \frac{a^{2}}{8c}T^{3}+(\ldots)T^{4}+\ldots$$
where we omitted the coefficient of $T^{4}$ since we won't need it. This equation is $d(T)$, but we want $T(d)$. We need to invert the [[series]] to do so, a process formally known as **reversion of series**. That's a bit complicated for the very simplistic model we're using, so we'll use more heuristic argument just to prove the point. We'll use something that comes in [[Teoria delle perturbazioni|perturbation theory]] a few times, which is to replace $d$ with its first order approximation. To first order, $d\simeq cT$ and so $T\simeq d/c$. Then, replacing this $T$ in the cubic term
$$d\simeq cT- \frac{a^{2}d^{3}}{8c^{4}}\quad\Rightarrow \quad T\simeq \frac{d}{c}+ \frac{a^{2}d^{3}}{8c^{5}}$$
and so on. Thus
$$T= \frac{1}{c}d- \frac{a^{2}}{8c^{5}}d^{3}+(\ldots)d^{4}+\ldots$$
Back to the series for $l$, we can now write it in terms of $d$:
$$l=\frac{a}{2c^{2}}d^{2}+ \frac{\dot{a}}{6c^{3}}d^{3}+(\ldots)d^{4}+\ldots$$
Put this in the self-force equation to eventually get
$$\mathbf{F}_\text{self}=\frac{q^{2}}{4\pi \varepsilon_{0}}\left[ - \frac{a}{4c^{2}d}+ \frac{\dot{a}}{12c^{3}}+(\ldots)d+\ldots \right]\hat{\mathbf{x}}$$
These accelerations are evaluated at the retarded time, but we express them in terms of the current time by yet another Taylor series:
$$a(t_{r})=a(t)+\dot{a}(t)(t_{r}-t)+\ldots=a(t)-\dot{a}(t)T+\ldots=a(t)-\dot{a}(t) \frac{d}{c}+\ldots$$
and so
$$\mathbf{F}_\text{self}=\frac{q^{2}}{4\pi \varepsilon_{0}}\left[ - \frac{a(t)}{4c^{2}d}+ \frac{\dot{a}(t)}{3c^{3}}+(\ldots)d+\ldots \right]\hat{\mathbf{x}}$$
The first term, the one in $a(t)$, can be equated with [[Newton's laws|Newton's second law]] to get the [[mass]] of the charges:
$$m=2m_{0}+ \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q^{2}}{4dc^{2}}$$
where $m_{0}$ is the mass of each individual charge on either side. In practice, the term adds an *effective* mass term to the system. In the context of classical physics, this seems really weird, but when confronted with relativity, it is rather sensible, as since $E=mc^{2}$, and
$$E=\frac{q}{2}V= \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_{0} } \frac{(q/2)^{2}}{d}\quad\Rightarrow \quad m=\frac{E}{c^{2}}=\frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{(q/2)^{2}}{dc^{2}}$$
The second term is something we've already discovered: the radiation reaction.
$$F_\text{rad}^{\text{int}}=\frac{\mu_{0}q^{2}\dot{a}}{12\pi c}$$
where we added $\text{int}$ as a superscript to indicate that this is the interaction between $(1)$ and $(2)$. These two terms are the only ones that don't scale with positive $d$, which means that in the $d\to 0$ limit, they are the only ones that remains, hence our previous results. Well, actually $d\to 0$ certainly has an effect on the mass adjustment, since $1/d\to \infty$. Of course, this is absurd, as it begs to imply the this internal force somehow adds infinite mass to the system, a fact that is manifestly false. This problem is only resolved in quantum electrodynamics by *renormalizing* mass so that this does not happen. For now, we'll just ignore the problem. Also, the radiation reaction is a little different from the one we know: it's half of it ($12$ at the denominator instead of $6$). This is because, as mentioned before, this is the interaction between $(1)$ and $(2)$. We are missing the interaction of $(1)$ with itself, which comes out identical (the charge is the same), and summing them (i.e. "integrating" over the whole distribution) gives the familiar result
$$F_\text{rad}=\frac{\mu_{0}q^{2}\dot{a}}{6\pi c}$$
In conclusion, the radiation reaction is a force that manifests itself due to unbalanced internal forces that leave a net force from a charge on itself.

[^1]: Technically, there's three energy "storage locations". The electric field is $\mathbf{E}=\mathbf{E}_\text{vel}+\mathbf{E}_\text{accel}$, but the energy depends on the square $E^{2}=E^{2}_\text{vel}+2\mathbf{E}_\text{vel}\cdot \mathbf{E}_\text{accel}+E^{2}_\text{accel}$. The cross term is, for simplicity, considered to be part of the velocity field, as it goes like $\sim \mathfrak{r}^{-3}$ and therefore does not affect radiation.

[^2]: If you're trying to solve for position, then it's third order since $a=\ddot{x}$ and $\dot{a}=\dddot{x}$, but we don't care about position here.
