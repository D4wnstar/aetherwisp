**Stellar aberration** is a phenomenon where the angle at which we perceive the location of a [[Stella|star]] is displaced due to the velocity of Earth, specifically in the direction of motion of Earth. More generally, it is a relativistic phenomenon where distant objects appear displaced to a fast moving observer, specifically in the direction of motion.

The **stellar aberration angle** $\alpha=\theta-\theta'$ describes the difference between perceived angle by a static observer $\theta$ and the one perceived by a moving observer $\theta'$. The relation between these two is
$$\tan \theta'=\frac{\sin \theta}{\gamma(\cos \theta-\beta)}$$
where $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are the usual [[Lorentz transformation|relativistic]] quantities. The tangent of the aberration angle itself is
$$\tan \alpha=\tan(\theta-\theta')=\frac{\tan \theta-\tan \theta'}{1+\tan \theta \tan \theta'}=\frac{\sin \theta'-\gamma(\cos \theta'+\beta)\tan \theta'}{\gamma(\cos \theta'+\beta)+\sin \theta'\tan \theta'}$$
For an angle $\theta'\to \pi/2$, we can see the asymptotic behavior as
$$\tan \alpha\simeq-\gamma \beta \simeq \alpha$$
