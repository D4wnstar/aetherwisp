The **Compton wavelength** $\lambda_{c}$ is a conventional [[wavelength]] assigned to a [[particle]] of [[mass]] $m$:
$$\lambda_{C}=\frac{h}{mc}$$
where $h$ is the [[Planck constant]]. It is the wavelength of a [[photon]] whose [[energy]] is the [[Relativistic energy|rest energy]] of the particle, as per the [[Relativistic energy|mass-energy equivalence]] $E=mc^{2}$. This definition originates from the [[Compton scattering]] phenomenon, where it appears naturally.

This relation is important because it gives a quantitative measure the "size" of a particle, as in the degree to which it is localized. The larger the rest mass, the shorter the Compton wavelength and hence the more strongly localized the particle is. As per 2022 CODATA values, the [[electron]] and [[proton]] Compton wavelengths are
$$\lambda_{\text{electron}}\simeq 2.426\times 10^{-12}\text{ m},\qquad\lambda_{\text{proton}}\simeq1.321\times10^{-15}\text{ m}$$
