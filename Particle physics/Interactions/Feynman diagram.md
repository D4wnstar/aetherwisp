A **Feynman diagram** is a schematic representation of an [[Fundamental interaction|interaction]] between [[Particle|particles]]. Although they are graphical tools, the components are defined in such a way as to represent fully rigorous calculations and are therefore reliable ways of describing interactions. They are used for both [[particle scattering]] and [[particle decay]].

For example, the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] attraction of an [[electron]] and a [[positron]] can be represented by the diagram

![[Feynman diagram Electron scattering|80%|center]]

which corresponds to the process
$$e^{-}+e^{+}\to e^{-}+e^{+}$$
in which the attraction is mediated by the exchange of a [[Photon]] $\gamma$.
### Components
Each diagram is divided in three sections:
1. The beginning of the time axis represents the initial state of the process.
2. The center of the time axis shows the interaction.
3. The end of the time axis shows the final state of the process.

How each of these are drawn is highly codified.

The motion of the particles follows a straight line with an arrow on it. The arrow is forward in time for particles and backwards for [[antiparticle|antiparticles]], echoing the fact that antiparticles can, at least mathematically, be interpreted as moving backwards in time.

The interaction is drawn in one of two ways:
- [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic interaction]] ([[Photon]]) uses a wavy line;
- [[weak interaction]] ([[W boson|W]] and [[Z boson|Z bosons]]) also uses a wavy line[^1];
- [[strong interaction]] ([[gluon]]) uses a coiled line.

[[Gravity]] is not understood at a particle level, so there is no definition for it.

The point at which the interaction begins and ends is shown with a filled circle and is called a **vertex**. The size of the vertex circle should be proportional to the square root of the [[coupling constant]] of the interaction.

Despite having a clear length on the time axis, the interaction is too brief for the [[force carrier]] to be perceivable. Force carriers in Feynman diagrams are always [[virtual particle|virtual particles]] and the visual length of the interaction line should not be assumed to have any meaning.

The time axis should always be drawn explicitly. This is especially true since keeping the time axis horizontal or vertical are both common options. Moreover, it's possible to draw diagrams that show processes in other variables, though time is the most common.
### Properties  
Feynman diagrams are drawings of actual calculations. As such, they hold all the properties of the math involved, namely:
- At each vertex, all [[quantum number|quantum numbers]] are conserved. They must also be identical to those of the force carrier.
- The exchange particle is inversely proportional to the square of the transferred momentum.
- The [[probability]] of interaction and the [[cross section]] are proportional to the square of the amplitude, represented by the diagram: $\text{Prob}\propto\sigma \propto |\ \ \rangle\!\!\sim\sim\!\!\langle\ \ |^{2}$.
