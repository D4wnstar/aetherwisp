The **Yukawa hypothesis** was a hypothesis proposed by Japanese physicist Hideki Yukawa that postulated the existence of a [[force carrier]] of the [[strong interaction]], analogous to what the [[Photon|photon]] is for the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic interaction]].

For example, the [[Particle scattering|elastic scattering]] of a [[proton]] and a [[neutron|neutron]], $n + p \rightarrow n + p$, would be mediated by this particle.

The yet-to-be-discovered particle was called a **[[pion]]** (symbol: $\pi$), thought to be a [[meson]] with a [[mass]] of approximately 140 [[electronvolt|MeV]]. Specifically, he postulated three types: $\pi^{+}$, $\pi^{-}$ and $\pi^{0}$, with different [[electric charge]] to account for different interactions. The existence of the pion would be later confirmed experimentally, winning Yukawa Nobel Prize for physics.

What he didn't expect was that the force carrier of strong force would actually be something else. It would later be discovered that the actual [[gauge boson]] of the strong force is a different particle known as the **[[gluon]]**.
