The **weak interaction** or **weak force** is the [[fundamental interaction]] that governs the [[Decadimento di particelle|decay]] of elementary [[Particle|particles]] and, by extension, the [[Nuclear decay|decay]] of [[atom|atoms]].

The modern theory of weak force is **electroweak theory** (EWT), which describes the weak force in conjunction with [[electromagnetism]]. In fact, at sufficiently high [[energy|energies]] ($\sim 246\text{ GeV}$, the **electroweak scale**), the two fundamental forces unify into a singular **[[electroweak interaction]]**. The weak interaction is an exchange interaction mediated by the [[W boson]] or the [[Z boson]], two of the four known [[gauge boson|gauge bosons]].

The weak interaction has a tiny range of only approximately $10^{-18}\text{ m}$, considerably less than even the effective radius of a [[proton]]. It is therefore relegated to subatomic interactions.
### Coupling constant  
Starting from the characteristic time of [[beta decay]], $\tau\sim10^{2}$ s, we can experimentally determine the effective Fermi coupling constant $G_{F}$:
$$G_{F}\simeq1.17\times10^{-5}\frac{(\hbar c)^{3}}{\text{GeV}^{2}}$$
Starting from this, we define the Fermi units of [[Fermi energy|energy]] and length:
$$E_{F}=\sqrt{\frac{(\hbar c)^{3}}{\sqrt{ 2 }G_{F}}}\simeq 246\text{ GeV},\quad\lambda_{F}=\sqrt{\frac{G_{F}}{\hbar c}}\simeq6.7\times10^{-19}\text{ m}$$
where $E_{F}$ is the electroweak scale (also called Fermi scale). The Fermi length $\lambda_{F}$ tells us that the effective range of weak interaction is just below $10^{-18}\text{ m}$. We take the conventional weak coupling constant $\alpha_{W}$ as  
$$\alpha_{W}(E_{F}^{2})\simeq\frac{1}{30}$$
Taking the [[Relativistic energy|rest energy]] of a proton $m_{p}\sim1$ GeV, we want to find the coupling constant at this scale. This is complicated quantum field theory math; I'll just report the result:
$$\alpha_{W}(\sim1\text{ GeV}^{2})\sim10^{-5}$$
which shows that the weak interaction is, indeed, weak on the nuclear scale.
