The **strong interaction** or **strong force** is the [[fundamental interaction]] that binds [[quark|quarks]] together to create composite [[Particle|particles]] known as [[hadron|hadrons]]. Since [[matter]] is made of [[Atom|atoms]], whose [[Nucleo atomico|nuclei]] are composed of [[Proton|protons]] and [[neutron|neutrons]], which in turn are made of quarks, the strong interaction is responsible for the stability of all atomic matter in the [[Universe]].

The modern theory of strong force is **quantum chromodynamics** (QCD), which explains strong force in a manner similar to quantum electrodynamics, but instead of having a singular [[electric charge]], it has three [[color charge|color charges]]. The strong interaction is an exchange interaction mediated by the [[gluon]], one of the four known [[gauge boson|gauge bosons]].

The strong interaction has a tiny range of only approximately $10^{-15}\text{ m}$, which is about the size of an atomic nucleus. It is therefore relegated to interactions within the nucleus.
### Coupling constant
The [[binding energy]] of the bound [[stato|state]] of a neutronâ€“proton system (the deuterium nucleus) is about 2 MeV, so the energy required to break a nucleus is generally on the order of 10 MeV. The effective strong coupling constant at this scale is, loosely
$$\alpha_{S}(\sim10\text{ MeV})\simeq 2.6$$
Taking the [[Relativistic energy|rest energy]] of a proton $m_{p}\sim 1\text{ GeV}$, through more complicated QFT math one finds
$$\alpha_{S}(\sim1\text{ GeV})\simeq 0.5$$
Compared to the other coupling constants at this scale, it is indeed the strongest of them all. The closest is [[electromagnetism]], at $1/137\simeq 0.07$, which is about 10 times weaker.
