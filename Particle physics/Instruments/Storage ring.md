A **storage ring** is a type of circular [[particle accelerator]] where the [[particle]] beam may be kept in circulation for extended periods of time, possibly hours. They are an evolution of the [[synchrotron]] design.

They were invented by American physicist Gerard K. O'Neill in 1956 as a method of constructing a [[Particle accelerator|collider]], although the first important storage ring, the Italian **ADA**, was constructed in 1961. Its revolution was being the first [[matter]]-[[antimatter]] collider in history, being an [[electron]]-[[positron]] collider reaching around 100 [[Electronvolt|MeV]] in [[center-of-mass energy]].

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of CERN, as of 2025 the most powerful collider in the world, is primarily a [[proton]] storage ring, though it's also used for heavy [[ion]] collisions like proton-lead and lead-lead.
