A **particle accelerator** is a machine whose purpose is to use [[Electric field|electric]] and [[Magnetic field|magnetic fields]] to accelerate [[particle|particles]] to very high speeds, typically very close to the [[speed of light]]. Their primary use in physics is to impart a huge amount of [[kinetic energy]] to particles and then have them collide with a target, leading to a [[particle scattering]] with extremely high [[center-of-mass energy]]. Accelerators that do this are called **colliders**. Other use cases come from nuclear medicine where they are used for some diagnostic techniques and radiotherapy.

Particle accelerators come in two shapes: linear accelerators (often called **linacs**) accelerate in a straight line and circular ones accelerate in a curved trajectory. They accelerate a large number of particles in a **beam**, which is focused into a thin, collimated line using quadrupoles. The curvature, if necessary, is taken care of by dipoles instead. The most common particles used are [[electron|electrons]] and [[proton|protons]] because they are the easiest to obtain, but other particles are sometimes used, such as [[electron|positrons]] in the medical technique of [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), used to visualize metabolic and biochemical activity.
### Types
Accelerators have gone through a lot of forms in the past. The original accelerator was the [[cyclotron]] (1932, due Ernest O. Lawrence), which got followed up by the [[synchrotron]] (1944, due Vladimir Veksler) and the [[storage ring]] (1961). That's not to say that first two are inherently worse: they are still in use today, especially in medical settings where cyclotrons are the most convenient due to their small size and low costs compared to building-sized storage rings.
