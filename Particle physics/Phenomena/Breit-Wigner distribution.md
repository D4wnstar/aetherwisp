The **Breit-Wigner distribution** is a [[probability distribution]] that models [[particle resonance]]:
$$P(E)=\frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{\Gamma}{(E-E_{n})^{2}+ \Gamma ^{2}/4}$$
$\Gamma$ is the **resonance width** or **decay width**, measured in [[Electronvolt|GeV]], and equal to 
$$\Gamma=\frac{\hbar}{\tau}$$
$\tau$ the [[mean lifetime]] of the [[Particle|particle]] that [[Nuclear decay|decays]]. $\Gamma$ is the [[full width at half maximum]] of the distribution.

In relativistic terms, $E_{n}$ is the [[Relativistic energy|rest energy]] of the resonance particle, $E_{n}=m_{0}c^{2}$ is the [[Relativistic energy|rest energy]]. Also expressing the argument $E$ as $E=mc^{2}$ we get
$$P(E)=\frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{\Gamma}{(mc^{2}-m_{0}c^{2})^{2}+\Gamma ^{2}/4}$$
which is the relativistic Breit-Wigner distribution.

It is the distribution of [[energy]] of a resonant [[stato|state]] which decays exponentially in time. It is a [[Cauchy distribution]] centered at the value $E_{n}$.
