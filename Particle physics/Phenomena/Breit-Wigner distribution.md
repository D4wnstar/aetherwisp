The **Breit-Wigner distribution** is a [[probability distribution]] that models [[particle resonance]]:
$$P(E)=\frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{\Gamma}{(E-E_{n})^{2}+ \Gamma ^{2}/4}$$
$E$ is the [[center-of-mass energy]] of the process, $E_{n}$ is the [[Relativistic energy|rest energy]] of the resonant particle and $\Gamma$ is the **resonance width** or **decay width**, measured in [[Electronvolt|MeV]] or GeV, and equal to 
$$\Gamma=\frac{\hbar}{\tau}$$
where $\tau$ the [[mean lifetime]] of the resonant particle. This is a consequence of the [[Disuguaglianza di Heisenberg|energy-time uncertainty principle]] $\Delta E\Delta t\gtrsim\hbar$: if the duration $\Delta t$ is the life of the particle $\tau$, there is an uncertainty on its rest energy $\Delta E\gtrsim \hbar/\tau$. If we take this to be lowest-uncertainty and call $\Delta E=\Gamma$ then $\Gamma\sim \hbar/\tau$. The resonance width is then the inherent quantum uncertainty on the rest energy of the resonant particle, which increases are particles become more short-lived. This is why it's also called decay width, as large $\Gamma$ mean faster, more likely decay.

Written in terms of [[invariant mass]] we have $E=m_{0}c^{2}$ and $E_{n}=m_{X}c^{2}$ and so
$$P(E)=\frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{\Gamma}{(m_{0}c^{2}-m_{X}c^{2})^{2}+\Gamma ^{2}/4}$$
which is the relativistic Breit-Wigner distribution.

The [[cross section]] of the [[particle scattering]] process in which the resonance occurs is locally proportional to the Breit-Wigner distribution around the mass peak. When $E=E_{n}$ (equivalently: $m_{0}=m_{X}$), the scattering resonates and maximizes the cross section (and therefore [[probability]]) of the resonant particle being formed. This is useful to more reliably produce resonant particles by manipulating the center-of-mass energy to be just right for the resonance.

Mathematically, it is the distribution of the [[energy]] of a resonant [[stato|state]] which decays exponentially in time. It is a [[Cauchy distribution]] centered on $E_{n}$. $\Gamma$ is the [[full width at half maximum]] of the distribution.
