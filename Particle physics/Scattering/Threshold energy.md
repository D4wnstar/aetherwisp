The **threshold energy** of a [[particle]] process is the minimum [[energy]] required for the process to occur. It is "minimal" in the sense that the process consumes all of this energy just to happen: the daughter particles will therefore have zero [[kinetic energy]] as there is none left to transfer.

Mathematically, for a process $a+T\to p_{1}+\ldots+p_{N}$ where $a$ is the projectile, $T$ is a stationary target and $p_{1},\ldots,p_{N}$ are the $N$ products, we define the threshold [[kinetic energy]] of the projectile as
$$K_{a}=\frac{1}{2m_{T}}\left[ \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \right)^{2}- (m_{a}+m_{T})^{2} \right]$$
The threshold energy proper is
$$E_\text{tr}=K_{a}+m_{a}$$
This definition uses [[natural units]].

It is primarily of interest in [[particle scattering]], where the energy can be controlled in experimental settings like [[particle accelerator|particle accelerators]], but it is a valid quantity in [[particle decay]] as well.
