The **luminosity**, in the context of [[particle scattering]] and [[particle accelerator|particle accelerators]], is the ratio between (detected) scattering events per unit time $\dot{N}$ and the [[Cross section]] $\sigma$ of the event:
$$\mathcal{L}=\frac{\dot{N}}{\sigma}\quad\left[ \frac{\text{collisions}}{\text{cm}^{2}\ \text{s}} \right]$$
If we call $\Phi_{B}$ the [[flux]] of incident particles from a particle beam and $N_{T}$ the number of particles in the target, we can also say
$$\mathcal{L}=\Phi_{B}N_{T}$$
The [[integral]] of the luminosity over a period of time is called the **integrated luminosity**:
$$\mathcal{L}_\text{int}=\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} \mathcal{L}\ dt$$
These quantities determine how many collisions a particle accelerator is capable of creating and as such the amount of data being generated for analysis. The product of integrated luminosity and cross section is the number of collisions measured:
$$N_\text{coll}=\mathcal{L}_\text{int}\sigma$$
As such, they are useful metrics to measure the performance of an accelerator: more luminosity means more data. Proton-proton collisions at the LHC at CERN can reach $10^{34}\text{ collisions}\text{ cm}^{-2}\text{ s}^{-1}$.
