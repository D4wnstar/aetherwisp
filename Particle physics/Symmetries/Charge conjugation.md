**Charge conjugation** $\hat{C}$ is a [[transformation]] that inverts the sign of all [[quantum number|quantum numbers]] of a [[Particle|particle]], transforming it into its [[antiparticle]]. It is a [[Symmetry|discrete symmetry]]. Despite being called "charge" conjugation, it does not just invert charge. It operates as
$$\hat{C}(Q,B,S,\ldots)=(-Q,-B,-S,\ldots)$$
where $Q$, $B$ and $S$ are quantum numbers associated with a particle. Using [[Notazione braket|ket]] notation for particle states, we can write it as
$$\hat{C}\ket{e^{-}} =\ket{e^{+}} ,\quad \hat{C}\ket{p} =\ket{\bar{p}} $$
using [[electron]]/[[Electron|positron]] and [[proton]]/antiproton as examples.

Charge conjugation is a [[unit operator]]: $\hat{C}^{2}=\hat{\mathbf{1}}$. Its [[Equazione agli autovalori|eigenvalues]] are therefore $P=\pm1$.
### Intrinsic charge conjugation
Each particle can be assigned an eigenvalue $C=\pm1$ depending on whether it is [[Symmetry|symmetric]] under charge conjugation or not. For example, conjugating the charge of the electron gives the positron. Because it changes, the electron and positron get $C=-1$. Similarly, the [[photon]] does change, $\hat{C}\ket{\gamma}=-\ket{\gamma}$ ([[polarization]] is flipped) so $C=-1$. Meanwhile, the neutral [[pion]]'s state does not change, so $\hat{C}\ket{\pi^{0}}=\ket{\pi^{0}}$. Then $\pi^{0}$ gets $C=1$.

All particles that are $C=1$ are their own antiparticles (e.g. $\pi^{0}$). The converse is not true (e.g. $\gamma$).

Intrinsic charge conjugation is conserved by all [[electromagnetism]] and the [[Strong interaction|strong force]]. It is violated by the [[Weak interaction|weak force]]. This proves useful to disallow some otherwise fine-looking decays, like $\pi^{0}\to\gamma+\gamma+\gamma$, which violates the C conservation of electromagnetism ($C_{\pi^{0}}=1$ at the start, $C_\text{end}=(C_{\gamma})^{3}=(-1)^{3}=-1$ at the end).
