The **CPT theorem** is a result that binds together [[parity]], [[charge conjugation]] and [[time reversal]].

> [!info] CPT theorem
> Parity, charge conjugation and time reversal [[symmetry]] cannot be violated all at the same time.

Basically, this says that regardless of [[Physical system|system]], subsequent application of parity, charge conjugation and time reversal always leads to a system that exhibits identical behavior. Effectively, applying all three "does nothing". It is nevertheless possible to violate each one individually (e.g. [[C violation]]) or even in pairs (e.g. [[CP violation]]).

This theorem has three consequences:
1. [[Mass]] and [[mean lifetime]] must be the same for any [[particle]] and its [[antiparticle]].
2. Antiparticles must have opposite quantum numbers compared to their particles.
3. Violating CPT means violating the inherent structure of [[spacetime]].
