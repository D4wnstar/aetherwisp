A **detector**, in the sense of a **particle detector**, is a tool whose purpose is to reveal the presence or activity of a [[particle]], such as a [[photon]] or [[muon]]. Detector physics is the field that deals with the mechanism behind particle detection and the methods that can be employed to this end. Since different particles behave in different ways, there's a wide variety of detector types. For example, photons are generally detected through the use of a [[scintillator]], which is a material that glows visible or UV light when excited by high-[[energy]] photons.

In many ways, detectors are just applications of material physics and specifically matter-radiation interaction, since individual particles are [[radiation]] colliding with the detectors material.
### Operation
The exact mechanism underlying a detector depends on the specific type of sensor being used, but some concepts are universal. For one, detectors are statistical objects: we don't speak of "detection" so much as the "[[probability]] of detection". This is for a variety of reasons, in part because much of microscopic space is empty, in part because quantum mechanics is fundamentally a probabilistic theory. See [[Cross section]] for quantification. We also know that the probability of detection is inversely proportional to its energy: high-energy particles are more likely to phase through the detector without triggering anything. This might come as a surprise since the common conception is that high-energy phenomena are always the flashiest, but in this case it's lower-energy particles are much easier to detect.

Detectors rely on essentially any property that a particle has, but some properties are more useful than others. The most useful property of any is probably the [[electric charge]]: its conserved, it's [[Relativistic invariant|invariant]], [[electromagnetism]] is very well understood, its very common, its effects are strong enough to be noticeable and have infinite range. Generally, charge is as good as it gets. When the particle lacks electric charge, as is the case with [[neutron|neutrons]] and [[neutrino|neutrinos]], the backup is either the [[Strong interaction|strong force]] (for [[hadron|hadrons]]) or the [[Weak interaction|weak force]] (for non-hadrons). In the dreaded case of a particle that does not interact with any of these, one must fall back to [[gravity]], which we don't have a good quantum understanding of, or some indirect means like conservation laws. Fortunately, the only instance of such particles are [[sterile neutrino|sterile neutrinos]], which are purely hypothetical for now. Unfortunately, these particles might be necessary to explain [[quantum gravity]].

Detectors fundamentally work by transferring energy from the incident particle into its components. Relevant phenomena for studying energy loss in matter include:
- the [[photoelectric effect]],
- [[Compton scattering]],
- [[pair production]], especially of two photons and an [[electron]]-[[positron]] pair,
- generally all kinds of [[particle scattering]].

Due to the randomness of interaction, most detection parameters are measured with [[probability distribution]]. To illustrate, consider a particle beam incident on a block of matter. For simplicity, say the energy of the incoming particles is identical for all of them. Two things might end up happening:
1. The particles are subject to numerous interactions, each absorbing a small bit of energy and causing a small deviation of the trajectory. This is common for most particles except the lightest ones. The outgoing beam will instead have a distribution of energies, randomized depending on how many interactions the incoming particles have while inside the block. Similarly, the beam will no longer be straight, but fan out in a cone depending on the random deviations. This behavior is described by the [[stopping power]] of the material.
2. The particles either don't interact, or interact in such a way that makes them vanish (such as photon absorption). This is more common in light particles, especially photons. In this case, the outgoing beam is identical to the incoming ones, because any interaction removes the particle outright, although it will be less intense. This behavior is still well-described by the classical [[Beer-Lambert law]].
