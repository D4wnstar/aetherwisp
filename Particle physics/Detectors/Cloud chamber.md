A **cloud chamber** is a track [[Detector|detector]] invented in 1912. It consists of a container filled with supersaturated vapor that produces condensation droplets due to adiabatic expansion, triggered externally with a piston, due to the sudden lowering of the [[temperature]]. This creates a cloud of vapor that is readily [[ionization|ionized]] when a [[Electric charge|charged]] [[Particle|particle]] passes through, leaving a short-lived trail of condensation where the particle passed. The chamber is photographed immediately after the passing to measure the track.

It has a typical resolution of $\sim 0.5$ mm. Much information can be reconstructed from the track thickness (ionization density $dE/dx$) and the track length (particle [[mass]] via the [[Range|range]]). A [[Magnetic field|magnetic field]] is commonly applied to make the trajectory turn in order to extract particle [[Linear momentum|momentum]] $p$ and thus mass $m$ from the curvature radius.

A **diffusion cloud chamber** is a later evolution of the cloud chamber that feature no pressure variation.
### Discoveries  
The [[Electron|positron]] was discovered using a cloud chamber. A track passing through a slab of lead was found to be produced by a positively charged particle (such as a [[proton]] or a [[muon]]), but measurements of both curvature and track length were consistent only with a particle with mass similar to that of an [[electron]].

The [[Lambda particle|lambda particle]] was also discovered using a cloud chamber with [[Cosmic ray|cosmic rays]]. During an experiment, an anomalous bifurcation in tracks was observed. The bifurcation indicates a [[Nuclear decay|decay]] and thus a particle with a short [[Radioactive decay law|mean lifetime]]. The absence of a track before the bifurcation indicates an electrically neutral particle. It was originally called $V_{0}$ because it produced a V-shaped bifurcation and was neutral ($Q=0$). The frequency of observation was consistent with a typical [[Cross section|cross section]] for the [[Strong interaction|strong interaction]], but the mean lifetime was too long for a truly strong process; it had to be a [[Weak interaction|weak decay]]. This strange property was described by a new [[quantum number|quantum number]] called [[Strange particle|strangeness]].
