The **baryon number** $B$ is a [[quantum number]] representing [[Baryon|baryons]], which are [[hadron|hardons]] with three [[Quark|quarks]]. It is equal to 1 for baryons and -1 for [[antiparticle|antibaryons]]. More technically, it is dependent on the number of quarks:
$$B=\frac{1}{3}(n_\text{quark}-n_\text{antiquark})$$
where $n_\text{quark}$ is the number of quarks in the hadron and $n_\text{antiquark}$ is the number of antiquarks. Since all known baryons either have three quarks or three antiquarks, this comes out to always be 1 or -1. [[Meson|Mesons]] always have one quark and one antiquark, so $B=0$ for all of them, as we should expect.

In the [[Standard Model]], the baryon number is always conserved regardless of [[fundamental interaction]]. Many theories beyond the Standard Model find this to not always be true in more exotic scenarios.
