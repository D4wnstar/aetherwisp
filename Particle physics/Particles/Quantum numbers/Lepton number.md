The **lepton number** $L$ is a [[quantum number]] representing [[lepton|leptons]]. It is 1 for leptons and -1 for antileptons. The lepton number is special in that it's actually three distinct numbers, one for each [[generation]] of leptons:
1. [[Electron|Electronic]] lepton number $L_{e}$
2. [[Muon|Muonic]] lepton number $L_{\mu}$
3. [[Tau]] lepton number $L_{\tau}$

It is conserved in all [[Fundamental interaction|interactions]]. More specifically, each lepton number is conserved separately, meaning that if a reaction involves more than one lepton generation, all of them need to conserve their own lepton number.

> [!example]- Muon decay
> An example of a reaction that uses two lepton numbers is the muon [[particle decay|decay]]:
> $$\mu^{-} \rightarrow e^{-}+\nu_{\mu}+\bar{\nu}_{e}$$
> The electronic lepton number is $0 \rightarrow 1 + 0 - 1$, so it is conserved, and the muonic lepton number is $1 \rightarrow 0 + 1 + 0$, which is also conserved. This reaction is therefore valid.
