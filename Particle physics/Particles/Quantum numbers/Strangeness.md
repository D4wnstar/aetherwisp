**Strangeness** $S$ is a [[quantum number]] representing [[Strange particle|strange particles]], a subset of [[hadron|hadrons]] containing one or more [[strange quark|strange quarks]]. Each strange quark contributes 1 to the strangeness and each strange antiquark contributes -1. A particle is called strange if it has nonzero strangeness.

Strangeness is conserved in [[Strong interaction|strong interactions]] but not in [[Weak interaction|weak]] ones. This is useful to rule any strong interaction that would cause strangeness conservation to be violated.
