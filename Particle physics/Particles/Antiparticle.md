An **antiparticle** is the inverse form of a [[particle]]. Each particle is predicted to have an antiparticle sibling, which is identical to the particle save for the fact that all [[quantum number|quantum numbers]] are reversed. The [[mass]] remains the same.

An antiparticle can, in some rare cases, be identical to its particle. In this case it is said "the particle is its own antiparticle."

For example, the [[electron]] has an [[electric charge]] number of 1 and an electronic [[lepton number]] of 1. The [[Electron|positron]], its antiparticle, has an electric charge of –1 and an electronic lepton number of –1. The mass of the electron and positron is the same. Meanwhile, the [[Photon]] is its own antiparticle.

When a particle and its antiparticle collide, they **[[annihilation|annihilate]]**: this is a very energetic process that leads to the disappearance of the pair and the creation of high-[[energy]] photons.
