The **neutron** $n$ is a [[baryon|baryonic]] [[hadron]] with no [[electric charge]]. It is one of the two components of the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] and therefore a fundamental part of [[matter]]. It is a [[baryon]] composed of one [[up quark]] and two [[down quark|down quarks]]. Its [[antiparticle]] is the **antineutron** $\bar{p}$.

## Discoveries
### Neutron decay
The process of neutron free [[particle decay]] eluded physicists for decades. While the [[Beta decay|beta minus decay]] was well known, the innerworkings of how it worked internally would not come to light until the [[quark model]] was introduced. Fermi originally thought beta decay was a four-particle contact interaction and that's not *completely* wrong. Using quark notation:
$$udd\to uud+e^{-}+\bar{\nu}_{e}$$
What's happening is that the [[down quark]] is being converted into an [[up quark]], releasing the [[electron]] and [[neutrino]] with it. This occurs through the [[Weak interaction|weak force]], specifically through the emission of a negative [[W boson]] and its subsequent decay into the electron/neutrino. However, the [[mean lifetime]] of the $W^{-}$ is so small that it is imperceptible at any reasonable [[energy]] scale, meaning it can be fully considered a contact interaction.
### The antineutron
The antineutron followed the discovery of the [[Proton|antiproton]] by about a year, also being discovered at the Bevatron, and actually in a rather similar fashion. In a photograph taken of a [[bubble chamber]] (a liquid-based, improved [[cloud chamber]]), scientists saw the presence of a weird track. An track simply vanished, but if you followed the track were it would've gone, it led to a starburst decay into four particles. This piqued interest, as the track that vanished couldn't have done it due to being stopped. This is because due to how [[stopping power]] works, particles lose more and more energy as the slow down, meaning that the track would've gotten thicker and thicker. Also, it would've curled really heavily due to being in a [[magnetic field]]. Neither were observed: it just vanished. The assumption was that an antiproton struck an ordinary proton in some nucleus and [[annihilation|annihilated]] into
$$p+\bar{p}\to n+\bar{n}$$
which is a valid [[Particle decay|decay]] path (plus possibly other particles). The neutrons are undetectable by the bubble chamber, so the normal one simply got stuck in the material while the antineutron traveled for a bit, then struck an ordinary neutron in some nucleus. This triggered annihilation into a four-particle starburst pattern (probably all [[pion|pions]]), which is a reasonable path. This was proof that the antineutron was likely to exist. An experiment was devised by Cork, Lambertson and Piccioni at the Bevatron to intentionally produce a beam of antiprotons with
$$p+p\to p+p+p+\bar{p}$$
and channel them into a series of [[Detector|detectors]] to artificially reproduce this event, which proved successful.
