The **neutron** $n$ is a [[baryon|baryonic]] [[hadron]] with no [[electric charge]]. It is one of the two components of the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] and therefore a fundamental part of [[matter]]. It is a [[baryon]] composed of one [[up quark]] and two [[down quark|down quarks]]. Its [[antiparticle]] is the **antineutron** $\bar{p}$.

## Discoveries
### Neutron decay
The process of neutron free [[particle decay]] eluded physicists for decades. While the [[Beta decay|beta minus decay]] was well known, the innerworkings of how it worked internally would not come to light until the [[quark model]] was introduced. Fermi originally thought beta decay was a four-particle contact interaction and that's not *completely* wrong. Using quark notation:
$$udd\to uud+e^{-}+\bar{\nu}_{e}$$
What's happening is that the [[down quark]] is being converted into an [[up quark]], releasing the [[electron]] and [[neutrino]] with it. This occurs through the [[Weak interaction|weak force]], specifically through the emission of a negative [[W boson]] and its subsequent decay into the electron/neutrino. However, the [[mean lifetime]] of the $W^{-}$ is so small that it is imperceptible at any reasonable [[energy]] scale, meaning it can be fully considered a contact interaction.
