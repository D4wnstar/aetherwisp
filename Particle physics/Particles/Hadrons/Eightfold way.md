The **eightfold way** is a 1961 theoretical model to classify and organize [[hadron|hadrons]] in a structured manner. It depicts [[meson|mesons]] in two octet and singlet groups and [[baryon|baryons]] in two octect and decuplet groups. It was developed by American physicist Murray Gell-Mann and led to the development of the [[quark model]].

The eightfold way starts with the proposition that hadrons should be shown on a plot with the $z$-projection of the [[isospin]] $I_{z}$ on the $x$ axis and the [[hypercharge]] $Y=B+S$ on the $y$ axis. This seems somewhat random at first, but it leads to surprising results. The **[[Gell-Mann-Nishijima rule]]** shows that mixing these two in just the right way gives the [[electric charge]]:
$$Q=I_{z}+ \frac{Y}{2}$$
This equation can be interpreted as a line of slope 1/2 and intercept $I_{z}$. Particles take place on this line based on their charge and end up forming the following geometric shapes.

The baryon decuplet. Note that the time of creation of the eightfold way, the $\Omega^{-}$ particle had not been discovered. It does, in fact, exist and was predicted through this plot, including its mass $m_{\Omega^{-}}=1672\text{ MeV}$ and lifetime $\tau_{\Omega^{-}}\sim 10^{-16}\text{ s}$. It was detected through the tracks of its decay products (too short-lived to detect directly).

Despite these results being extremely interesting, it leaves some things to be desired. The major step forward historically was to take the considerations from the eightfold way and step into the domain of [[Quark|quarks]] with the [[quark model]].
