A **kaon** is a [[strange particle|strange]] [[meson]] that comes in two types, charged kaons and neutral kaons.
- Charged kaons are written $K^{+}$ and are made of an [[up quark]] and an anti-[[strange quark]] ($u\bar{s}$) with [[antiparticle]] $K^{-}$.
- Neutral kaons are written $K^{0}$ and are made of a [[down quark]] and an anti-strange quark ($d\bar{s}$), with antiparticle $\bar{K}^{0}$ (though it's more complicated than this; see [[#Neutral kaon mixing]] below).
### Production and decay
All kaons [[Particle decay|decay]] via the [[Weak interaction|weak interaction]]. The most common decays are in two or three [[pion|pions]] 
$$K^{0,\pm} \rightarrow 2\pi / 3\pi$$
(pion types depend on the charge being conserved) and, for charged kaons, in a [[muon]] plus [[neutrino|muonic neutrino]]
$$K^{+}\to \mu^{+}+\bar{\nu}_{\mu},\quad K^{-}\to \mu^{-}+\nu_{\mu}$$
They are often produced in [[Particle scattering|collisions]] between pions and [[proton|protons]]:  
$$\pi^{-} + p \rightarrow K^{0}+\Lambda \quad, \quad \pi^{+}+p \rightarrow K^{0}+K^{-}+p$$
