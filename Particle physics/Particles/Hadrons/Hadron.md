A **hadron** is a subatomic [[Particle|composite particle]] made of two or more [[Quark|quarks]] held together by the [[Strong interaction|strong force]]. All known hadrons are made of either two or three quarks:
 - Hadrons with two quarks are called [[meson|mesons]].
 - Hadrons with three quarks are called [[baryon|baryons]].

Two of the most common particles in the [[Universe]] are hadrons: the [[proton]] and the [[neutron]], both baryons. The join together to make up [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] which, when combined with [[electron|electrons]] (which are [[lepton|leptons]]), create [[atom|atoms]]. As such, hadrons and specifically baryons are the building blocks of all [[matter]].
