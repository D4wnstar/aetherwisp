The **electron** is an [[Particle|elementary particle]] with a negative [[electric charge]] equal to one [[Elementary charge|elementary charge]]. Specifically, it is the first-[[generation]] [[lepton]] and, excluding [[neutrino|neutrinos]] and massless particles, it is the lightest known particle by mass. It has [[spin]] 1/2, which makes it a [[Fermion|fermion]].

The [[antiparticle]] of the electron is called the **positron**.
