A **lepton** is an subatomic [[Particle|elementary particle]] with [[spin]] 1/2 that does not [[Strong interaction|interact strongly]]. They are all [[Fermion|fermions]]. We know three kinds, called **generations**, of leptons: the [[electron]], the [[muon]] and the [[tau|tauon]]. Each is associated with a [[neutrino]]: electronic neutrino, muonic neutrino and tau neutrino. In total, these six [[flavor|flavors]] comprise all known leptons in the [[Standard Model]].

Leptons are characterized by a nonzero [[lepton number]]. Each flavor has its own quantum number.
