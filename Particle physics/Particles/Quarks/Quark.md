A **quark** is an [[Particle|elementary particle]] with fractional [[electric charge]] and [[spin]] 1/2. All quarks are therefore [[Fermion|fermions]]. Quarks are the fundamental unit with which [[hadron|hadrons]] are composed of and are one of the major components of the [[Standard Model]]. Being fermions, they are described by the [[Dirac equation]], which implies the existence of antiquarks. There are six [[flavor|flavors]] of quarks:
1. [[Up quark]] $u$
2. [[Down quark]] $d$
3. [[Strange quark]] $s$
4. [[Charm quark]] $c$
5. [[Top quark]] $t$
6. [[Bottom quark]] $b$

[[Baryon|Baryons]] are particles made of three quarks or antiquarks and [[meson|mesons]] are made of one quark and one antiquark. The theoretical description of quarks as a whole is given by the [[quark model]].

Quarks are known to interact with all four [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental interactions]]. They are an integral part of the [[Strong interaction|strong force]], as quarks appear to be the only particles in existence capable of interacting this way (barring, of course, the [[gluon]] [[gauge boson]] that is the [[force carrier]]).
### Etymology
The name "quark" comes from a nonsensical passage in James Joyce's *Finnegan's Wake*:

> Three quarks for Muster Mark!  
> Sure he hasn't got much of a bark  
> And sure any he has it's all beside the mark.

Murray Gell-Mann, a fan of Joyce, decided to take the word to name these particles.
