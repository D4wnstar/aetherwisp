A **quark** is an [[Particle|elementary particle]] with fractional [[electric charge]] and [[spin]] 1/2. All quarks are therefore [[Fermion|fermions]]. Quarks are the fundamental unit with which [[hadron|hadrons]] are composed of and are one of the major components of the [[Standard Model]]. Being fermions, they are described by the [[Dirac equation]], which implies the existence of antiquarks. There are six [[flavor|flavors]] of quarks:
1. [[Up quark]] $u$
2. [[Down quark]] $d$
3. [[Strange quark]] $s$
4. [[Charm quark]] $c$
5. [[Top quark]] $t$
6. [[Bottom quark]] $b$

[[Baryon|Baryons]] are particles made of three quarks or antiquarks and [[meson|mesons]] are made of one quark and one antiquark. The theoretical description of quarks as a whole is given by the [[quark model]].

Quarks are known to interact with all four [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental interactions]]. They are an integral part of the [[Strong interaction|strong force]], as quarks appear to be the only particles in existence capable of interacting this way (barring, of course, the [[gluon]] [[gauge boson]] that is the [[force carrier]]).
### The mass problem, $\Delta^{++}$ and color
The two common quarks are up and down. They were the first to be discovered (alongside strange) and are by far the most common. All ordinary [[matter]] is composed of ups and downs due to [[proton|protons]] and [[neutron|neutrons]] being made of these. However, there's a fundamental problem. Estimates of the mass of these two leads to tiny masses: 2 to 5 [[Electronvolt|MeV]] to be exact. But then how come protons and neutrons, being made of only three of these, can have masses nearly 1000 MeV strong? That's nearly a 500 times difference!

Even estimating quark mass is incredibly hard. Quarks make up hadrons and are not found in isolation, so there's no hope of, say, cracking a proton and measuring its quarks one by one. Thus, we're stuck with either theoretical mass or computer simulations, both of which are limited by our understanding of nature.

Another related problem is the very existence of the $\Delta^{++}$ [[delta resonance]]. It's supposed to be made of three up quarks ($uuu$), but it's really hard to fit in the quark model. To see why, notice that it's a spin 3/2 fermion (each $u$ is 1/2). It is the lightest baryon with no orbital [[angular momentum]]. The [[wavefunction]] associated with $\Delta^{++}$ (a Dirac [[bispinor]], so four components) is [[Permutation operator|symmetric]] with respect to flavor changes, since it's entirely made of ups and no amount of reordering those will make a different particle. Also, all ups have the same spin (up), so it's also symmetric in the spin component. The spatial components also comes out to be symmetric. But then all components are symmetric and thus the entire wavefunction is. But fermions can't be symmetric, that's the whole definition! $\Delta^{++}$ would have to be a [[boson]] for this to be true, but that's just not right. There must be something missing, a fourth piece to the puzzle as Dirac suggests.

This new component does exists and it is called **[[color]]**. It is a new [[quantum number]] and the fourth and final piece to the quark puzzle. Critically, the color component is [[Permutation operator|antisymmetric]], which makes the entire wavefunction antisymmetric with it as we expect. The wavefunction associated with a particle is, in general, of this shape:
$$\psi _\text{quark}=\psi _\text{flavor}\psi _\text{spin}\psi _\text{space}\psi _\text{color}$$
Color also serves to explain the mass problem, though it's much more complicated. See [[Color#Quark dynamics and hadron structure]] for more.
### Etymology
The name "quark" comes from a nonsensical passage in James Joyce's *Finnegan's Wake*:

> Three quarks for Muster Mark!  
> Sure he hasn't got much of a bark  
> And sure any he has it's all beside the mark.

Murray Gell-Mann, a fan of Joyce, decided to take the word to name these particles.
