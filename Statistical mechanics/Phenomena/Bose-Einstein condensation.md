**Bose-Einstein condensation** is the tendency of [[Boson|bosons]] to collectively and almost exclusively occupy the ground [[stato|state]] of a [[Physical system|system]] around a specific [[temperature]], known as the condensation temperature or critical temperature. This phenomenon occurs at low temperatures and low energies. Mathematically, it is readily seen from the [[Bose-Einstein distribution]], which gives the average [[occupation number]] of each state:
$$\langle n_{i} \rangle =\frac{1}{e^{\beta(\varepsilon_{i}-\mu)}-1}$$
We can see that the distribution has a [[Singolarit√† isolata|singularity]] when the exponential is $1$, which means when $\mu=0$ and $\varepsilon_{i}\to 0$. This leads to a massive spike of occupation numbers around zero energy, which occurs at very low temperatures. This means that at these temperatures, bosons collectively end up in the ground state, leaving other states nearly unoccupied.

The asymptotic nature of $\langle n_{i} \rangle$ near the condensation temperature means that it can be seen macroscopically. Also, this only occurs in three dimensions: one- and two-dimensional ideal [[Bose gas|boson gases]] do not exhibit this behavior.  For a discussion on the exact temperature at which it occurs, see [[Bose gas#Critical condensation temperature]].
