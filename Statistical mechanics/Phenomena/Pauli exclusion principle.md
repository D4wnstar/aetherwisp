The **Pauli exclusion principle** is the phenomenon where two [[Fermion|fermions]] in the same [[Physical system|system]] cannot simultaneously occupy the same [[Stato|state]]. It is a consequence of the [[Stato total-antisimmetrico|antisymmetry]] of a fermion system's [[Funzione d'onda|wavefunction]].
### Origin
The principle is directly derived from the antisymmetry of fermion states. Consider a [[Numero quantico|quantum numbers]] which we use to uniquely identify states. Call $a$ and $b$ two possible values for this number[^1]. Then, a fermion can be in two distinct states: $\ket{a}$ or $\ket{b}$. Now say we have two coupled fermions. Their mixed state $\ket{\psi}$ must be a [[combinazione lineare|linear combination]] (due to [[Identical particles|indistinguishability]]) and specifically a difference (due to antisymmetry) of pure states:
$$\ket{\psi} =\ket{ab} -\ket{ba} $$
If $\ket{a}$ and $\ket{b}$ represent different states, this is a valid mixed state. However, if both fermions are in the same state ($a=b$), we have
$$\ket{\psi} =\ket{aa} -\ket{aa} =0$$
The mixed state vanishes. Thus, two coupled fermions cannot coexist in the same state.

[^1]: These need not be the *only* values for the number, there may be more or even infinite, but they need to be distinct.
