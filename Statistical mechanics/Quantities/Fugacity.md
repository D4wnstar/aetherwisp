The **fugacity** $z$ is a quantity that represents a [[Physical system|system]]'s tendency to expand isothermically. In terms of the [[chemical potential]] $\mu$ it is defined as
$$z\equiv e^{\beta \mu}$$
where $\beta=1/k_{B}T$, $k_{B}$ is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and $T$ is the [[temperature]]. If the fugacity is available, it is possible to derive the chemical potential from it as
$$\mu=k_{B}T\ln z$$
