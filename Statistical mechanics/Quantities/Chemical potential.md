The **chemical potential** $\mu$ is an [[energy]] difference that determines the amount of energy that needs to be spent to add a [[Particella|particle]] to a [[Physical system|system]]. Despite being called a [[potenziale|potential]], it cannot be defined up to a constant as it is already a difference of two energies.

It is important in the description of the [[grand canonical ensemble]], where the number of particles is variable, but also generally describes the energy of adding a particle to a system like the [[Elettrone|electron]] shell of an [[Atomo|atom]].

It can be expressed in terms of the [[Helmholtz free energy]] and [[Gibbs free energy]] as
$$\mu=\left( \frac{ \partial A }{ \partial N }  \right)_{V,T}=\left( \frac{ \partial G }{ \partial N }  \right)_{P,T}$$
If $\mu>0$, then if $N$ increases (i.e. particles are added), so do $A$ and $G$.
