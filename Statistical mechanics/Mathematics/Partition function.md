The **partition function** of an [[ensemble]] is something idk

Usually denoted using $Z$, which comes from German "Zustandsumme" or $Q_{N}$ (in Huang's).
### Properties
It acts as the normalization constant of a set of probabilities.
$$p(x)=\frac{1}{Z}e^{-E(x)/k_{B}T}\qquad Z=\sum_{x} e^{-E(x)/k_{B}T}$$
This can be extended to statistical ensembles by seeing $p$ as the density function $\rho$ and $E$ as the Hamiltonian $H$.
