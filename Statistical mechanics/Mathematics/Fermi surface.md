For a [[Physical system|system]] of [[Fermion|fermions]], the **Fermi surface** is the [[Superficie|surface]] in [[phase space]] that divides occupied [[Stato|states]] from unoccupied ones at zero [[temperature]]. Its existence is a consequence of the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which prevents more than one fermion from simultaneously occupying a state. It is the surface identified by the [[Fermi energy]] of the system.
