The **Fermi-Dirac distribution** is a [[probability distribution]] that describes the behavior of a [[Physical system|system]] of $N$ [[Fermione|fermions]] in [[thermal equilibrium]]. Its [[probability density function]] is
$$\langle n_{i} \rangle =\frac{1}{e^{\beta(\varepsilon_{i}-\mu)}+1}$$
$\langle n_{i} \rangle$ is the average number of fermions in the $i$-th single-[[Particella|particle]] [[stato|state]] of energy $\varepsilon_{i}$, $\mu$ is the system [[chemical potential]] and $\beta=1/k_{B}T$ is the inverse temperature, with $k_{B}$ the [[Boltzmann constant]] and $T$ the [[temperature]]. The [[Normalizzazione|normalization]] constant is
$$\sum_{i}n_{i}=N$$
Since we are working with fermions, the [[principio di esclusione di Pauli|Pauli exclusion principle]] must hold, which is to say that $\langle n_{i} \rangle< 1$.
