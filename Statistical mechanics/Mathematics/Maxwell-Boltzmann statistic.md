The **Maxwell-Boltzmann statistic** or **distribution** (not to be confused with the *other* [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution]]) is a real, continuous [[probability distribution]] that describes the behavior of a [[Physical system|system]] of $N$ classical [[Particle|particles]] in [[thermal equilibrium]]. Its [[probability density function]] is
$$\langle n_{i} \rangle =\frac{1}{e^{\beta(\varepsilon_{i}-\mu)}}=ze^{-\beta \varepsilon_{i}}$$
$\langle n_{i} \rangle$ is the average number of particles in the $i$-th single-particle [[stato|state]] of energy $\varepsilon_{i}$, $\mu$ is the system [[chemical potential]], $\beta=1/k_{B}T$ is the inverse temperature, with $k_{B}$ the [[Boltzmann constant]] and $T$ the [[temperature]], and $z$ is the [[fugacity]]. The [[Normalization|normalization]] constant is
$$\sum_{i}n_{i}=N$$
This distribution is closely related to its quantum equivalents, the [[Fermi-Dirac distribution]] and the [[Bose-Einstein distribution]]. These converge to the Maxwell-Boltzmann statistic at high temperature.
