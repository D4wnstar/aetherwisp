The **Bose-Einstein distribution** is a [[probability distribution]] that describes the behavior of a [[Physical system|system]] of $N$ non-interacting [[Boson|bosons]] in [[thermal equilibrium]]. Its [[probability density function]] is
$$\langle n_{i} \rangle =\frac{1}{e^{\beta(\varepsilon_{i}-\mu)}-1}=\frac{1}{z^{-1}e^{\beta \varepsilon_{i}}-1}$$
$\langle n_{i} \rangle$ is the average number of fermions in the $i$-th single-[[Particella|particle]] [[stato|state]] of energy $\varepsilon_{i}$, $\mu$ is the system [[chemical potential]], $\beta=1/k_{B}T$ is the inverse temperature, with $k_{B}$ the [[Boltzmann constant]] and $T$ the [[temperature]], and $z$ is the [[fugacity]]. The [[Normalizzazione|normalization]] constant is
$$\sum_{i}n_{i}=N$$
Bosons are not subject to the [[Pauli exclusion principle|Pauli exclusion principle]], so $\langle n_{i} \rangle$ can be any positive real.
### Bose-Einstein condensation
Note that this function diverges if $e^{\beta(\varepsilon_{i}-\mu)}=1$, which is to say $\mu=0$ and $\varepsilon\to 0$. In this state, the ground state's occupation number blows up to infinity and all other states becomes unoccupied, which means that all bosons "collapsed" into the ground state. This is called [[Bose-Einstein condensation]] and it only occurs in bosons due to the $-1$ term at the denominator.
