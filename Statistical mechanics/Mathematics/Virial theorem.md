The **virial theorem** provides a relation between the total [[kinetic energy]] and the total [[Potential|potential energy]] of a stable [[Physical system|system]] of [[Particella|particles]] subject to a [[conservative force]]. If the force comes from a potential of the form $U(r)=ar^{n}$, where $r$ is the distance between particles, the theorem states
$$2\langle K_\text{total} \rangle =n\langle U_\text{total} \rangle $$
A common use of this theorem is in gravitationally bound, many-particle systems such as [[Stella|stars]], where the [[Gravity|gravitational potential]] is $U(r)\sim r^{-1}$, which leads to
$$2\langle K_\text{total} \rangle +\langle U_\text{total} \rangle =0$$

It is similar to the [[equipartition theorem]], which instead correlates kinetic energy with [[temperature]].
