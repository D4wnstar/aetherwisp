The **random phase hypothesis** (or postulate, or approximation) is an assumption that is made in [[quantum statistical mechanics]]. It states that a [[stato|state]] of equilibrium can be seen as an incoherent superposition of states. In other words, there is no [[interference]] between separate [[ampiezza di probabilit√†|probability amplitudes]] and [[Probability|probabilities]] can be summed over without worrying about cross terms. This allows one to express an equilibrium state as a simple sum over [[Equazione agli autovalori|eigenstates]].
