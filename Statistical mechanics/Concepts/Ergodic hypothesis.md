The **ergodic hypothesis** states that, if one waits for a long enough time, the geometric locus of a [[Phase space|representative point]] covers the whole [[phase space]]. In other words, the point will eventually travel through the entirety of phase space, leaving no location unvisited. This implies that the point density (which represents the [[probability distribution]] of [[stato|states]]) is [[Uniform distribution|uniform]] over a constant-[[energy]] [[hypersurface]], which means that all states on that surface are equally likely. This statement is known in statistical mechanics as the [[equal a priori probability hypothesis]].
