The **ergodic hypothesis** states that, if one waits for a long enough time, the geometric locus of a [[Phase space|representative point]] covers the whole [[phase space]]. In other words, the point moves arbitrarily close to any other point in the space. This means that the [[stato|state]] density $\rho$ is constant over an constant-[[energy]] hypersurface, which means that all states on that surface are equally likely.
