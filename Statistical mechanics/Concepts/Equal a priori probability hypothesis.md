The **equal *a priori* probability hypothesis** (also called a postulate) states that if a macroscopic [[Physical system|system]] is in [[thermal equilibrium]], its [[stato|microstates]] can be any one that satisfies the macroscopic conditions, all with equal [[probability]]. In other words, there is no "privileged" microscopic state. In a single sentence

> [!info] Equal a priori probability hypothesis
> For an isolated system in equilibrium, all accessible microstates are equally likely.

The word "accessible" here refers to states that are within reach thanks to [[energy]] fluctuations, if they are presents.

This is a working hypothesis and not something that is strictly proven in classical mechanics, as even if it were proven from the equations of motion, we'd have to prove it again in a quantum field later to fully justify it. It is a natural extension of the [[ergodic hypothesis]].
