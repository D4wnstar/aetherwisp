The **equal *a priori* probability hypothesis** (also called a postulate) states that an [[Physical system|isolated system]] can be in any [[Stato|microstate]] that satisfies the macroscopic conditions, all with equal [[probability]]. In other words, there is no "privileged" microscopic state. In a single sentence:

> [!info] Equal a priori probability hypothesis
> For an isolated system of defined [[energy]], all microstates consistent with that energy are equally likely.

In a more geometric sense, this hypothesis is saying that the [[probability distribution]] of states (equivalently, the density of [[Phase space|representative points]]) over a constant-energy [[hypersurface]] in [[phase space]] is [[Uniform distribution|uniform]].

This is a working hypothesis and not something that is strictly proven in classical mechanics, as even if it were proven from the equations of motion, we'd have to prove it again in a quantum field later to fully justify it. It is a natural consequence of the [[ergodic hypothesis]].
