The **thermodynamic limit** is the theoretical limit of a material body with $N$ [[Atomo|atoms]] and volume $V$ where
$$N\to \infty,\quad V\to \infty,\quad \frac{N}{V}=\text{constant}=n=\frac{1}{v}$$
which is achieved by extending the body to infinite size whilst maintaining its atomic density $N/V=n$ constant. $v$ is the *specific volume* of the body. The value of this limit is that in it, only [[Intensive property|intensive properties]] apply.
