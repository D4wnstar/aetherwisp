The **microcanonical ensemble** is an [[ensemble]] where the density function is
$$\rho(p,q)=\begin{cases}
\text{constant} & E<H(p,q)<E+\Delta \\
0&\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$
where $H$ is the [[Hamiltoniana|Hamiltonian]] of the [[Physical system|system]]. Basically, the density is non-zero only in a specific bracket of energy $[E,E+\Delta]$, and constant within that bracket. $\Delta$ is a small constant ($\Delta\ll E$) that allows for some uncertainty in the energy measurements. Since the density function describes the [[probability]] that the system will be in a given [[stato|state]], all allowed states of a microcanonical ensemble are equally likely, which satisfies the [[equal a priori probability hypothesis]].
