 An **ideal gas** is an approximate model of the behavior of a gas that holds for low density gases. It is sparse and has weak internal interactions that limit [[information]] exchange. The dynamics are determined by the **ideal gas law**:
$$PV=Nk_{B}T=nRT$$
where $P$ is the [[pressure]], $V$ is the volume occupied by the gas, $N$ is the number of [[particella|particles]] composing the gas, $k_{B}$ is the [[Boltzmann constant]], $T$ is the [[temperature]], $n$ is the number of [[mole|moles]] and $R$ is the [[ideal gas constant]]. The latter form exists because, besides being of practical convenience, thermodynamics was historically developed at a time where the existence of the [[atomo|atom]] had yet to be proven and with it, the [[Particella|particle]] division of matter. In fact, classical thermodynamics as a whole does not strictly require the existence of particles like atoms.

### Properties
The [[heat capacity]] by volume of a monatomic ideal gas is
$$C_{V}=\frac{3}{2}Nk_{B}$$
### Entropy
The [[entropy]] of an ideal gas can calculated as a function of volume $V$ and temperature $T$ by explicitly integrating $dS=dQ/T$. Let's consider a [[stato|state]] $A$, which we approach from two different states: one using an constant-volume transformation (path 1), the other using a isothermal one (path 2).

Along path 1, $V$ is constant, so
$$\int \frac{dQ}{T}=C_{V}\int \frac{dT}{T}$$
and thus if we start the transformation at temperature $T_{0}$ we get
$$S(V,T)=S(V,T_{0})+C_{V}\int_{T_{0}}^{T} \frac{dT}{T}=S(V,T_{0})+C_{V}\ln \frac{T}{T_{0}}$$

Along path 2, $T$ is constant, so
$$dU=0$$
and thus, using the [[Laws of thermodynamics|first law of thermodynamics]] and the ideal gas law, we get
$$dQ=dW=PdV=Nk_{B}T \frac{dV}{V}$$
which gives us, starting from $V_{0}$,
$$S(V,T)=S(V_{0},T)+Nk_{B}\int_{V_{0}}^{V} \frac{dV}{V}=S(V_{0},T)+Nk_{B}\ln \frac{V}{V_{0}}$$

The entropy for the two paths must be equal, so comparing the two expressions for $S(V,T)$ we get (TODO: Figure out how this even works)
$$S(V,T_{0})=C_{0}+Nk_{B}\ln V$$
 where $C_{0}$ is an arbitrary constant. Absorbing $V_{0}$ into $C_{0}$ we can write
 $$S(V,T)=C_{0}+Nk_{B}\ln V+C_{V}\ln T$$
 This depends on the nature of the gas itself, because of $C_{V}$. For a monatomic ideal gas, we have
$$S(V,T)=C_{0}+Nk_{B}\ln(VT^{3/2})$$
#### In the microcanonical ensemble
The entropy can also be calculated by modeling an ideal gas as a [[microcanonical ensemble]] of [[Hamiltonian]]
$$H=\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{\mathbf{p}^{2}_{i}}{2m}$$
We use the entropy given by the sigma function $S=k_{B}\log \Sigma(E)$ where
$$\Sigma(E)=\frac{1}{h^{3N}}\int\limits_{H(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p})<E}d^{3}q_{1}\ldots d^{3}q_{N}\,d^{3}p_{1}\ldots d^{3}p_{N}$$
and $h$ is a dimensionally appropriate constant, specifically $\text{impulse}\times\text{length}$, which gives $\text{energy}\times\text{seconds}$. We can develop this as
$$\Sigma(E)=\left( \frac{V}{h^{3}} \right)^{N}\int\limits_{H(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p})<E}d^{3}p_{1}\ldots d^{3}p_{N}$$
Since the energy of a particle under no potential is $E=p^{2}/2m$, the momentum is $p=\sqrt{ 2mE }$. This momentum describes a $n$-[[palla|ball]] of radius $R=p=\sqrt{ 2mE }$ in the momentum-only [[phase space]], but the integral finds the volume of that ball in phase space (by finding the representative points contained therein), so we can rename the integral as a function $\Omega_{3N}(R)$ which finds the volume of a $3N$-dimensional ball of radius $R$:
$$\Sigma(R)=\left( \frac{V}{h^{3}} \right)^{N}\Omega_{3N}(R)$$
In general, $\Omega_{3N}$ is
$$\Omega_{3N}(R)=\int\limits_{x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+\ldots+x_{n}^{2}<R^{2}}dx_{1}\ldots dx_{n}$$
(in our case, $x\equiv p$). We know both $V$ and $h$ ($h$ just needs to have the correct dimensions, so might as well be $h=1 \text{ Js}$ in this case), so in order to find $\Sigma$ and therefore $S$, we just need to solve $\Omega$ in $3N$ dimensions. Thankfully, $\Omega$ can be solved generally for any integer $N$ (see [[Volume of an n-ball]]), which gives
$$\Omega_{3N}=\frac{\pi^{3N/2}}{\Gamma\left( \frac{3N}{2}+1 \right)}R^{3N}$$
where $\Gamma$ is the [[Gamma function]]. Thus, we have
$$\Sigma(R)=\left( \frac{V}{h^{3}} \right)^{N} \underbrace{ \frac{\pi^{3N/2}}{\Gamma\left( \frac{3N}{2}+1 \right)} }_{ c_{n} }R^{3N}=\left( \frac{V}{h^{3}} \right)^{N}c_{3N} (2mE)^{3N/2}$$
and entropy
$$S=k_{B}\log \Sigma(R)$$
We can use the fact that $\Gamma(n+1)=n!$ and the [[Stirling approximation]] $\log n!=n\log n-n+O(\log n)$ to get [[Steps Entropy microcanonical ideal gas]].
