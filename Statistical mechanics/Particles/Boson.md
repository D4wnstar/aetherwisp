A **boson** is a [[Particle|particle]] with integer [[spin]] (0,1, ...). The [[funzione d'onda|wavefunction]] of a [[Physical system|system]] of $N$ bosons does not change sign when subject to a coordinate [[permutazione|permutation]]:
$$P_{ij}\psi(\mathbf{r}_{1},\ldots,\mathbf{r}_{i},\ldots,\mathbf{r}_{j},\ldots,\mathbf{r}_{N})=\psi(\mathbf{r}_{1},\ldots,\mathbf{r}_{j},\ldots,\mathbf{r}_{i},\ldots,\mathbf{r}_{N})$$
$P_{ij}$ is the [[permutation operator]]. This wavefunction is said to be **symmetric** (or even) under particle exchange. Their behavior in matter is described by the [[Bose-Einstein distribution]].
### Origin
The existence of bosons as a separate category arises from the [[Identical particles|indistinguishability]] of particles caused by the [[Disuguaglianza di Heisenberg|uncertainty principle]].
