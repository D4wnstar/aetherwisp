The **angstrom**, written $\mathring{\text{A}}$, is a unit of distance used in [[atom|atomic]] physics equal to $10^{-10}\text{ m}$. It is a tenth of a nanometer, $1\ \mathring{\text{A}}=0.1\text{ nm}$. It's useful in the study of atoms because they are generally one or a few angstroms large, up to the outermost [[electron shell model|electron shell]]. For instance, the classical diameter of the [[hydrogen atom]] is about $1.06\ \mathring{\text{A}}$ (twice the [[Bohr radius]]).
