The **electronvolt**, written $\text{eV}$, is a unit of [[energy]] equal to $1.6\times10^{-19}$ J. It is defined as the energy acquired by a [[particle]] with [[elementary charge]] $e$ when it crosses an [[electric potential]] difference of $1\text{ V}$. Its SI multiples are quite common: $\text{keV}$, $\text{MeV}$, $\text{GeV}$, and $\text{TeV}$.

The electronvolt typically doubles as a unit of [[mass]]. According to the [[Relativistic energy|mass-energy equivalence]] $E=mc^{2}$, the electronvolt can be interpreted as a unit of mass:
$$1 \frac{\text{ eV}}{c^{2}}=1.7\times 10^{-36}\text{ kg}$$
Though tiny, this scale of mass/energy is quite common in nuclear and particle physics. Since most processes in this domain rely on [[Lorentz transformation|relativistic]] calculations where energy is frequently exchanged with mass, using electronvolts to refer to rest mass ends up being much more convenient. For instance, the mass of the [[proton]] is $m_{p}=938 \text{ MeV}/c^{2}$.

Note that for electronvolts to measure mass they must be weighed by $c^{2}$. As such, [[natural units]] are quite useful, in which $c\equiv1$. In these units, the $c^{2}$ disappears and mass and energy become truly equivalent. Then, mass can be written in $\text{eV}$, e.g. $m_{p}=938\text{ MeV}$.
