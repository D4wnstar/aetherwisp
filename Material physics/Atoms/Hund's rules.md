**Hund's rules** are a set of rules that explain how [[electron|electrons]] organize around an [[atom]]. They were originally found empirically and then developed theoretically later on.
1. Complete [[electron shell model|electron shells]] have $L=S=0$. The values of $L$ and $S$ are determined exclusively by the incomplete shells.
2. Equivalent electrons (electrons with the same $l$) are arranged as to maximize $S$. States with higher multiplicity have lower [[energy|energies]].
3. Electrons are arranged as to maximize $m_{L}=\sum m_{l}$.
4. In multiplets with subshells that are less than half filled, the term with *lowest* $j$ has the lowest energy. In mutliplets with subshells that are more than half filled, the term with *highest* $j$ has the lowest energy.
