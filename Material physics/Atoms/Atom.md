The **atom** is the [[physical system]] that acts as the building block of matter. Outside of exotic or extreme physics, all matter is composed of atoms, either individually or bound together to form [[molecule|molecules]], [[crystal|crystals]] or other forms of matter.

An atom is composed of two parts: a central [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nucleus]] and an [[electron]] cloud surrounding it.
1. The **atomic nucleus** is the center of the system. It is an approximately spherical object composed **[[proton|protons]]** and **[[neutron|neutrons]]** bound to each other through [[Strong interaction|strong interaction]]. It is positively [[Electric charge|charged]] and has a radius of approximately $\sim10^{-13}$ cm or $\sim1$ fm.
2. The **electron cloud** surrounds the nucleus. It is a collection of one or more negatively charged electrons bound by [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic interaction]] to the nucleus. The radius of the electron cloud depends on the amount of electrons and their energy level, but roughly speaking, it is on the order of $\sim10^{-8}$ cm or $\sim0.1$ nm. The Angstrom is also commonly used, $1\ \mathring{\mathrm{A}}\equiv 0.1\text{ nm}$.

This shape was proven empirically in 1911 by the [[Rutherford experiment]].
### Notation
Atoms conventionally use then notation $\ce{^{A}_{Z}X_{N}}$, where:
- $\mathrm{X}$ is the chemical symbol.
- $Z$ is the number of protons, called the **atomic number** or **nuclear charge**. In a neutral atom, it is also the number of electrons.
- $A$ is the **atomic mass number**. It is the integer closest to the ratio of the mass of the nucleus and the atomic mass unit. Though not the definition, in practice $A=Z+N$.
- $N$ is the **number of neutrons**. It is equal to $A - Z$. This is typically not written out explicitly.

For example, uranium (at least, the most common [[Isotope|isotope]]) is written as $\ce{_{92}^{238}U_{146}}$, which means that uranium has a mass of (approximately) 238 atomic masses, has 92 protons, and 146 neutrons. More commonly, it's written $\ce{^{238}_{92}U}$ without $N$ at the bottom right.
