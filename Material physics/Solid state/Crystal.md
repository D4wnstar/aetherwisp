A **crystal** is a material that exhibits a periodic structure at a microscopic level, called the **crystal structure**. If the periodicity is extended through the entire specimen, it is simply called a crystal or a **monocrystalline** material. Otherwise, if the specimen is made up of many smaller pieces, each with their own crystalline structure, then it is said to be a **polycrystalline** material. Polycrystalline specimens are much more common in nature.

Mathematically, a crystal can be described by giving its underlying [[Bravais lattice]] alongside a description of the arrangements of its [[atom|atoms]], [[Molecule|molecules]], [[ion|ions]], etc. within a particular primitive cell of the lattice. This arrangement is known as the **basis** of the lattice. The crystal structure then consists of copying each cell alongside its basis to fill space, using the lattice points as markers on where to place the cells[^1].

A honeycomb crystal. The honeycomb pattern is *not* the Bravais lattice. The Bravais lattice is the points at the intersections between the [[parallelogram|parallelograms]]. Each parallelogram is a primitive cell. Each cell contains two atoms, bonded as per the thick solid line, which constitutes the basis. The parallelogram alongside the basis is the crystal structure. Copying the crystal structure near every lattice points yields the actual physical crystal.

You can see how the honeycomb pattern is restored by the bonds (dotted lines) that spontaneously form by placing each piece of the crystal structure next to another. From *Ashcroft & Mermin, Chapter 4*.
