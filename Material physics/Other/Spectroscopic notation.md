**Spectroscopic notation** is a convention for denoting the values of [[Numero quantico|quantum numbers]], especially in the context of [[atom|atomic]] quantum numbers.
- The principal quantum number $n$ is denoted with usual numbers, $n=1,2,3,\ldots$
- The azimuthal quantum number $l$ is denoted with a specific set of letters:

| Number | Letter |
| ------ | ------ |
| 0      | $s$    |
| 1      | $p$    |
| 2      | $d$    |
| 3      | $f$    |
| 4      | $g$    |
| 5      | $h$    |

- If needed, the magnetic quantum number $m$ also uses numbers, $m=\ldots,-1,0,1,\ldots$. They are added as subscript to the azimuthal quantum number, for instance $p_{-1}$ for the state $l=1,m=-1$, but they are typically omitted for brevity since they often do not matter.

Some examples are
- $(n,l,m)=(1,0,0)=1s_{0}$
- $(n,l,m)=(2,1,-1)=2p_{-1}$
- $(n,l,m)=(4,3,2)=4f_{2}$
