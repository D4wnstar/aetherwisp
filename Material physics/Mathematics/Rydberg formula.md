The **Rydberg formula** is a general formula to calculate the wavelength of a [[photon]] emitted by any [[State transition|state transition]] of the [[hydrogen atom]]. It is given by
$$\frac{1}{\lambda}=R\left(\frac{1}{n^{2}_{a}}- \frac{1}{n_{b}^{2}}\right)$$
where $\lambda$ is the wavelength, $R$ is the [[Rydberg constant]], and $n_{a}$ and $n_{b}$ are the principal [[numero quantico|quantum numbers]] of the states involved in the transition, after and before respectively. They are integers and $n_{a}>n_{b}$.

It was first found empirically and then formalized by Bohr in his [[Bohr model]] of the hydrogen atom.

For historical reasons, the series of transitions from any state $n_{i}$ to a final state $n_{f}$ are given special names in honor of their original discoverers:
- For $n_{f}=1$, we have the **Lyman series**.
- For $n_{f}=2$, we have the **Balmer series**.
- For $n_{f}=3$, we have the **Paschen series**.
- For $n_{f}=4$, we have the **Brackett series**.
- For $n_{f}=5$, we have the **Pfund series**.
