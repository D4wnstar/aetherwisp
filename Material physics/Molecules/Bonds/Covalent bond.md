A **covalent bond** is a primary [[chemical bond]] caused by the sharing of [[electron|electrons]] between two [[atom|atoms]]. Each atom contributes one electron, forming an **electron pair** (also called **bonding pair**).

Covalent bonding is a fundamentally quantum phenomenon that cannot be described in a satisfactory manner with classical physics alone (unlike [[Ionic bond|ionic bonds]], which can to an extent). This is because covalent bonding occurs due to the superposition of the quantum [[Funzione d'onda|wavefunctions]] of electrons (called [[orbital|atomic orbitals]]) to form [[molecular orbital|molecular orbitals]]. The strength and shape of the bond is determined by this overlap.
