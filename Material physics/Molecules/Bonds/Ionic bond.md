An **ionic bond** is a primary [[chemical bond]] caused by the [[electromagnetic interaction|electromagnetic]] attraction between [[ion|ions]]. These ions are formed by the transfer of an [[electron]] from one stable [[atom]] to another, leaving them both [[Electric charge|electrically charged]]. The reduction in total [[energy]] is due to moving into an [[electric potential]] well.

The [[cohesive energy]] an ionic bond makes are usually in the order of a few [[Electronvolt|electronvolts]] per bond, and they are most likely to be formed when the atoms involved have either low [[ionization|ionization energy]] or high [[electronic affinity]] (preferably both). They often make simple [[Crystal|crystal structures]].

Since ionic bonds are caused by electromagnetism (a static [[electric field]] in particular), they can be explained quantitatively even without the use of quantum mechanics, at the cost of ending up with somewhat imprecise results.
### Examples
> [!example]- Table salt
> Table salt ($\text{NaCl}$) is a [[Crystal|crystalline solid]] made up of $\text{Na}^{+}$ and $\text{Cl}^{-}$ ions, which are [[Chemical bond|bonded]] to each other by ionic bonds. The energy gain in an individual $\text{NaCl}$ molecule is given by the difference between the ionization energy of $\text{Na}$ ($5.1\text{ eV}$) and the electronic affinity of $\text{Cl}$ ($3.7\text{ eV}$), which is $1.5\text{ eV}$. The electronic affinity is just  the electric potential energy

> In a solid, molecules are not cleanly divided. Table salt has a crystal structure made up of two interlocked FCC [[Bravais lattice|Bravais lattices]], one for sodium and one for chlorine. Each sodium is surrounded by six chlorines at a distance $a$, so the energy gain due to being in the potential of chlorine is six times larger than the individual molecule, $6E_\text{Coulomb}$. Meanwhile, at a distance $a/\sqrt{ 2 }$, there are twelve sodiums, which repel the central sodium with a potential energy
> $$E_\text{Coulomb}=12\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi \varepsilon_{0}a\sqrt{ 2 }}$$
> Further on, there are eight more chlorine, which attract, then more sodiums, which repel, and so on and so forth. This makes a [[serie|series]] which is proven to converge to
> $$E_{\text{Na}}=- M_{d} \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi \varepsilon a}$$
> where $M_{d}$ is known as a **[[Madelung constant]]**, a property of the lattice. For this lattice, it is $M_{d}=1.748$. This is the energy for a single sodium atom. The total lattice energy (not the cohesive energy) is
> $$E_\text{tot}=\frac{2E_{\text{Na}}\times N_{A}}{2}\simeq861\text{ kJ/mol}$$
> where $N_{A}$ is the [[Avogadro number]]. The experimental value is $\simeq 776\text{ kJ/mol}$.
