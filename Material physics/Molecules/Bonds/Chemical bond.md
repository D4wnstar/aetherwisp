A **chemical bond** is an interaction between [[atom|atoms]] or [[ion|ions]] that aggregates them into a unified structure, such as a [[molecule]], a [[crystal]] or other material object.

Bonds are broadly categorized in two kinds:
- **primary bonds** form rigid, stable structures. They include [[covalent bond|covalent]], [[ionic bond|ionic bonds]] and [[metallic bond|metallic bonds]] among others;
- **secondary bonds** are weaker and typically form looser superstructures on top of the ones built by primary bonds. They include [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen bonds]], [[dipole-dipole interaction|dipole-dipole interactions]] and [[London forces]].

Stable bonds occur naturally because the bonded [[stato|state]] exists at a lower [[energy]] than the unbound state, making it more stable, so by the [[least action principle]] a [[physical system]] will naturally tend to fall into this bonded state. As such, all stable bonds are characterized by a reduction in energy compared to the unbound state. This is known as the **[[bond energy]]**, which is a type of [[binding energy]].

> [!question] A note on nomenclature
> Primary and secondary bonds are also called **strong** and **weak bonds**. I prefer the former terminology, even though the latter one is more common, just to avoid any accidental correlation with the [[Strong interaction|strong]] and [[Weak interaction|weak forces]], which can be seen as forming bonds of their own ([[quark|quark confinement]] is in a way as a strong (interaction) bond, but not a strong (chemical) bond).
